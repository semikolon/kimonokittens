### February 2025

*   **Finalized and documented the February 2025 rent calculations after extensive scenario modeling.**

### July 2025

*   **Reconstructed and Stabilized the `RentCalculator` Module (July 4, 2025)**
    *   **Context:** A critical `rent.rb` file containing all business logic was accidentally deleted due to being untracked in git.
    *   **Action:** The module was successfully reconstructed from scratch by using the existing RSpec test suite as a guide for the required behavior.
    - **Outcome:** All 53 tests for the `RentCalculator` and `RentHistory` systems are now passing. Key bugs related to key symbolization, float vs. integer rounding, remainder distribution, and presentation logic were identified and fixed. The system is now stable.
    *   **Key Learning:** This event underscored the value of a comprehensive test suite and the importance of committing all work, even if incomplete. Technical learnings from this process have been documented in `DEVELOPMENT.md`.

*   **Migrated the core `RentCalculator` backend from a legacy file-based system (SQLite and versioned JSON files) to a unified PostgreSQL database managed by Prisma. This involved a significant refactoring of the API handler and a complete rewrite of the integration test suite to be database-driven.**
