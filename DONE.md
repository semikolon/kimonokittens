# Accomplishments & Historical Milestones

This file tracks major completed tasks and project milestones.

---

### February 2025

*   **Finalized and documented the February 2025 rent calculations after extensive scenario modeling.**

### July 2025

*   **Reconstructed and Stabilized the `RentCalculator` Module (July 4, 2025)**
    *   **Context:** A critical `rent.rb` file containing all business logic was accidentally deleted due to being untracked in git.
    *   **Action:** The module was successfully reconstructed from scratch by using the existing RSpec test suite as a guide for the required behavior.
    - **Outcome:** All 53 tests for the `RentCalculator` and `RentHistory` systems are now passing. Key bugs related to key symbolization, float vs. integer rounding, remainder distribution, and presentation logic were identified and fixed. The system is now stable.
    *   **Key Learning:** This event underscored the value of a comprehensive test suite and the importance of committing all work, even if incomplete. Technical learnings from this process have been documented in `DEVELOPMENT.md`.

*   **Migrated the core `RentCalculator` backend from a legacy file-based system (SQLite and versioned JSON files) to a unified PostgreSQL database managed by Prisma. This involved a significant refactoring of the API handler and a complete rewrite of the integration test suite to be database-driven.**

*   **Implemented the `<RentPanel/>` UI and Backend Forecasting (July 5, 2025)**
    *   **Context:** The application needed a primary user interface to display rent calculations and forecasts.
    *   **Action:** Developed a new React component (`<RentPanel/>`) to show a detailed rent breakdown. The backend was enhanced to generate on-the-fly forecasts for future months. A data correction script was created to populate historical tenant start and departure dates, ensuring forecast accuracy.
    *   **Outcome:** The application now has a functional UI for viewing rent data. Numerous frontend (React/Vite) and backend (Ruby/Postgres) integration bugs were resolved, including data type mismatches, key inconsistencies, and environment configuration issues. 

*   **Implemented Real-Time Updates for the Rent Panel (July 5, 2025)**
    *   **Context:** The `<RentPanel/>` needed to reflect database changes instantly without requiring a manual page refresh.
    *   **Action:** A full-stack WebSocket system was implemented. The Ruby backend now broadcasts a `rent_data_updated` message whenever financial data is changed. The React frontend listens for this message and automatically reloads the page.
    *   **Outcome:** The user experience is now seamless and reactive. All API and WebSocket proxy issues in the Vite development environment were resolved, and the backend server was stabilized by fixing several gem dependency conflicts.
