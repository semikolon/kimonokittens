# Internal Contract Policy Notes

## Inredningsdeposition - Depreciation Considerations (Nov 2025)

### Current Policy
- **Entry**: 2,200 kr to outgoing tenant
- **Value claim**: "Det totala värdet av gemensamma inredningsartiklar överstiger depositionens belopp"
- **Exit**: Get 2,200 kr back (minus damage/loss deductions, or minus value of items taken)

### Items Included (Partial List)
- **Major purchases**: Sopkärl (1,100 kr), växter (3,000+ kr initially, many died)
- **Textiles**: Crushed velvet fabric, large carpets, white fluffy blanket, many pillows
- **Lighting**: Floor lamps, table lamps, blockljus, light strings
- **Storage**: Small cabinets, förvaringslösningar
- **Kitchen**: Cups, wine glasses, köksredskap
- **Tech**: Smart home power plugs
- **Misc**: Städmaterial, and many accumulated items over time

### Value Claim Justification
Even accounting for plant deaths and normal wear-and-tear, total value of all items significantly exceeds 2,200 kr per person. Sopkärl alone represents half the deposit amount.

### Depreciation Challenge - Future Consideration

**The problem**: Items depreciate over time through:
- Normal use (trash bins get worn, fabrics fade)
- Collective responsibility failures (plants die because only one person waters)
- Accidents and breakage

**The question**: Should departing tenants who lived 6+ months get back slightly less than 2,200 kr to account for collective depreciation of items they used?

**Why it's hard**:
- Feels "cruel" to deduct 100-200 kr from someone's deposit for normal use
- How to fairly calculate depreciation rate?
- How to separate individual damage from collective wear?
- Creates administrative burden and potential conflicts
- Might discourage good tenants from joining

**Why it matters**:
- Fredrik absorbs all depreciation costs currently
- Over 5+ years, this could be significant (esp. if plants keep dying, carpets wear out, etc.)
- Not inherently "selfish" to want fair cost-sharing for depreciation

**Current approach**:
Don't mention depreciation in contract. Keep system simple for newcomers. Absorb depreciation as collective cost. Revisit if it becomes unsustainable.

**Possible future approaches**:
1. Annual small deduction (e.g., 50 kr per 6 months lived) applied to all departing tenants
2. Depreciation fund: collect 100 kr/month from everyone, use to replace worn items
3. Individual item tracking: deduct only for items they personally damaged
4. Accept depreciation as cost of collective living (current approach)

**Decision**: Deferred until clearer pattern emerges or depreciation becomes financially significant.

## Single Source of Truth - Governance (Nov 2025)

**Current state**:
- Contract `.md` files: Legal source text
- Handbook `docs/agreements.md`: Explains system to residents
- **Manual sync required** between these

**Future consideration**: Create canonical spec document (`contracts/specs/inredningsdeposition_spec.md`) that both contract template and handbook reference.

**Challenge**: How to enforce/maintain sync between spec and documents? Risk of drift.

**Decision**: Focus on getting contracts ready ASAP. Governance structure is future optimization.
