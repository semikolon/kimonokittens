# Project Overview – Kimonokittens Handbook

The handbook is a Git-backed wiki and economic dashboard for the Kimonokittens collective.

* **Audience**: house-mates and future residents.
* **Goal**: keep agreements, procedures and finances transparent & easy to update.
* **Stack**: React (Vite) + Tailwind v4 + Radix UI on the client; Ruby Agoo + Rugged + Postgres on the server.
* **Auth**: Facebook OAuth via Next-Auth; avatar & first-name shown in UI.
* **Workflow**: edit-in-place Markdown → proposal stored in `proposals/` → two approvals → auto-merge to `wiki/`.
* **Real-time**: WebSocket push so pages refresh instantly after merge.
* **Obsidian**: pull-only sync for those who prefer desktop vaults.
* **Financial data**: Prisma models (`Tenant`, `RentLedger`) drive dynamic components like `<RentPanel/>` inside MDX pages.
