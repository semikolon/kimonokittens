  # RoommateStore manages persistent roommate information for the rent calculator.
  # It stores both permanent roommates and their adjustments, as well as temporary
  # stays and changes in the living situation.
  #
  # This allows for natural interactions like:
  # "Elvira is moving in next month"
  # "Astrid is moving out on the 15th"
  # "Amanda is staying for 10 days in December"
  # "The small room now has a 1500kr discount"
  #
  # The data is then automatically used in all calculations until updated.
  #
  # Validation Rules:
  # - Warns if total roommates would be less than 3 or more than 4
  # - Requires confirmation for room adjustments over 2000kr
  # - Never accepts stay days over 31
  # - Suggests using default full month when days are set to 30/31
