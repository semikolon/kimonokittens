# Managing Contracts & Shared Agreements

This document outlines why and how we should manage our collective's important agreements using this handbook system.

## The Importance of Written Contracts

In Sweden, verbal agreements (`muntliga avtal`) for renting are legally binding. However, for a collective, relying on them is risky because:

-   **Proof is difficult:** In case of a disagreement, it's nearly impossible to prove what was decided.
-   **Details get lost:** Specifics about notice periods, shared costs, and responsibilities can be easily forgotten or misinterpreted.

Therefore, our policy should be to have **written agreements** for all tenants. This protects everyone and ensures clarity.

### Types of Agreements to Digitize:

1.  **Tenancy Contracts (`Inneboendekontrakt`):** Individual agreements for each member of the collective.
2.  **House Rules (`Ordningsregler`):** A living document for shared space etiquette (cleaning, guests, noise levels).
3.  **Meeting Notes (`MÃ¶tesprotokoll`):** A record of decisions made during house meetings.
4.  **Shared Purchases:** Agreements on co-owned items (e.g., a lawnmower, a projector).

## Using the Handbook as Our Single Source of Truth

This handbook application is designed to solve the problem of scattered or verbal-only agreements.

**Benefits:**

-   **Centralized:** All important documents live at one URL, accessible to everyone.
-   **Transparent:** Everyone can read the current, active versions of all agreements.
-   **Version Controlled:** Every change is tracked in Git, so we have a full history of all modifications.
-   **Collaborative:** Changes can be proposed through the app's "edit-in-place" feature and must be approved by at least two other members before becoming official.

By storing our contracts and house rules here, we create a reliable, transparent, and fair system for managing our shared home.
