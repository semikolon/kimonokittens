# Historical Electricity Costs

## Overview
We have two electricity suppliers:
1. **Vattenfall** - Grid supplier (nätleverantör)
2. **Fortum** - Electricity supplier (elleverantör)

Bills typically arrive at the beginning of the month for the previous month's consumption.
For example, bills due February 4-5 are for January's consumption.

## Important Notes

### Billing Cycle
- Both suppliers bill for the same consumption month
- Bills arrive around the same time (2nd-5th of each month)
- Example: Bills arriving early February (due ~Feb 4-5) are for January's consumption
- This creates a natural one-month lag in our rent calculations

### Payment Arrangements
- Regular rent is split equally among all roommates
- For separate electricity payments (e.g., overdue bills):
  - Fredrik covers both his and Rasmus's shares (as Rasmus was not involved in January 2025's decisions)
  - Frans-Lukas and Elvira pay their individual shares
  - This arrangement started January 2025 with the December 2024 electricity bills
  - First instance: December 2024 bills (4,226.48 kr total)
    - Fredrik paid: 2,114 kr (covering both shares)
    - Frans-Lukas and Elvira: 1,057 kr each
- Regular rent payments remain equally split regardless of electricity arrangements
- This special arrangement only applies to electricity bills affected by January 2025's events

### Special Cases
- When bills are handled separately from rent:
  1. Each person's share is calculated: total_cost ÷ 4 (rounded up)
  2. The amount is excluded from next month's rent calculation
  3. The payment is tracked in this document
  4. Example: December 2024's bills (paid January 2025)
     - Total: 4,226.48 kr
     - Per person: 1,057 kr
     - Fredrik paid: 2,114 kr (covering both shares)
     - Others paid: 1,057 kr each

## Patterns and Notes
- Grid costs (Vattenfall) tend to increase during winter months (November-February)
- Highest bills typically in January/February
- Summer months (June-September) have lower costs
- Consumption costs (Fortum) follow a similar seasonal pattern
- Winter months can see costs 10-20x higher than summer months
- Billing cycle:
  - Bills arrive early in the month (usually 2nd-5th)
  - Each bill is for the previous month's consumption
  - Vattenfall and Fortum bills for the same consumption month arrive around the same time
- 2025 trend:
  - Grid costs (Vattenfall) have increased ~10-25% vs 2024
  - Consumption costs (Fortum) have decreased ~25-30% vs 2024
  - February 2025: 5,945.23 kr total vs 6,317.38 kr in 2024 (~6% lower)
  - January 2025: 4,763.18 kr total vs 4,638.79 kr in 2024 (~3% higher)
  - Unusual pattern with grid costs rising while consumption costs fall

## Rent Calculation Impact
- When calculating rent for month X (due end of month X-1):
  - We use electricity bills from month X-2 (as those arrive in early X-1)
  - Example: March rent (due end of Feb) uses January's consumption bills
- This means there's always a lag between consumption and payment in rent
- Final rent amounts may need adjustment if bills arrive after rent calculation 

## Roommate Changes
- February 2025: Frans-Lukas moved out
  - March 2025 rent (due Feb 27) split between 3 people
  - Increased per-person share significantly (10,560 kr vs 7,993 kr projected)
