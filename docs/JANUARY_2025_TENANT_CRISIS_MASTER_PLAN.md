# January 2025 Tenant Crisis - Master Plan

**Created:** December 10, 2025
**Last Updated:** December 10, 2025 (Wed ~22:00 - Added Lisa's friend as hot lead from FB scraper testing)
**Status:** ACTIVE CRISIS
**Owner:** Fredrik Bränström

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Situation:** After 3 years of running Kimono Kittens kollektiv, a crisis triggered by Sanna's psychotic/manic episode caused everyone to flee. This forced a "total omstart" - 3-4 rooms becoming vacant simultaneously in January 2025.

**Root Cause:** Sanna became psychotic and manic, unsafe to be around. Rasmus left, Frida (mid-move) abandoned her move-in and signed for an apartment instead, Adam is leaving for India with Mikael. Fredrik is likely the only one staying - but also wants to leave, yet is financially trapped.

**Financial Exposure:**
- Monthly house rent: ~29,700 kr
- If Fredrik alone in January: Full liability
- If no tenants found by Jan 27: ~60,000 kr exposure (Jan + Feb)

**Current Status:**
- Ad posted to 6+ Facebook groups + personal feed
- Response: 70-80+ likes in top groups
- Active leads for January: 4 (Katarina, Marie, Lisa's friend, + more scraper prospects TBD)
- February backups: Ronja, Isabelle+Jimmy (both interested but can't do January)
- Timeline: 17 days until January rent due (as of Dec 10)
- Sanna move-out: In progress - not sleeping there, door closed, Rasmus asked for updated plan (Dec 10 Wed PM)
- **Isabelle+Jimmy: DECLINED for January** (Dec 10 20:54) - too stressful timeline, but very interested for later
- **Adam offer:** If Fredrik gets 2 tenants but missing 1, Adam willing to help with rent shortfall if it means he gets deposit back soon

**Contingency options being considered:**
- AirBnB for Jan/Feb as emergency
- Payment plan with BA + terminate contract + move to parents
- "Det beror lite på hur det går nu med roomies iofs. Vi får se."

## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS SUMMARY (Deep Think Results)

### Market Intelligence - YOU HAVE THE ADVANTAGE

**Stockholm Housing Crisis Works IN YOUR FAVOR:**
- Average 1-room in central Stockholm: 13,000-14,000 SEK
- Your pricing (6,000-7,900 SEK): **48-54% below market**
- Karolinska Huddinge (Hälsovägen 13) = 5 min from your house
- January = peak student/professional transition period

**Success Probability: 75-85%** (high confidence with proper execution)

**Key Insight:** This isn't a "housing crisis" - it's a **market opportunity**. The risk isn't finding tenants - it's choosing the WRONG tenants out of desperation.

### Lead Priority Scores (Calculated)

**For January:**
| Lead | Priority Score | Why |
|------|----------------|-----|
| **Katarina Leander** | 95% | Karolinska proximity, kollektiv experience, perfect cultural fit - but timeline uncertain (job interview) |
| **Marie Ritter** | 60% | Unknown fit, "space needs" concern, needs assessment call |
| **Scraper prospects** | TBD | Building scraper to find more "seeking housing" posts |

**February backups:**
| Lead | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Ronja Eriksson** | Good fit | "Troligast februari" |
| **Isabelle + Jimmy** | Very interested | Declined Jan (too stressful), enthusiastic for later |

### The 72-Hour Blitz Strategy

**Core Insight:** Don't build scrapers. Don't panic-post. Execute parallel lead closure.

**Day 1 (Today):** Contact all leads simultaneously
**Day 2-3:** Phone/video calls with top prospects
**Day 4:** First closures or pivot

### Scraper Verdict: LOW PRIORITY

Build it ONLY if Dec 20 deadline passes without 2+ committed tenants. Current pipeline is sufficient.

### Alternative Vision: AI Kollektiv

**See:** [AI_KOLLEKTIV_VISION.md](./AI_KOLLEKTIV_VISION.md)

A different spin on the kollektiv concept - targeting AI/tech people, experienced coders, potential co-founders. This is a **long-term vision**, not a January solution. Could pursue in parallel or after stabilization.

Key insight: Small, high-trust, AI-enhanced teams can now compete with large organizations. Living with AI-aligned people could unlock upward spirals through daily knowledge exchange, shared tooling, and startup incubation.

## PART 1: CURRENT HOUSEHOLD STATUS

### The Sanna Crisis - Root Cause of the Exodus

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The "total omstart" was triggered by Sanna becoming psychotic and manic, making her unsafe to be around. This caused a cascade:

- **Everyone fled the house** when it became clear she was unstable
- **Rasmus** has been acting as a "double agent" - maintaining communication with Sanna to know when she's actually moving out
- **Frida** was literally mid-move (packing boxes) when the crisis hit - she abandoned the move and signed for a separate apartment instead
- The situation remains unresolved regarding exactly when Sanna will be out

### Who's Leaving

| Name | Current Room | Departure | Status | Notes |
|------|--------------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Sanna Juni Benemar** | Downstairs | In progress | LEAVING (crisis) | Psychotic/manic episode - unsafe. **Dec 9 (Tue AM):** Said leaving that night, won't sleep there, will return to pack at scheduled times, avoiding Fredrik/Adam, paid through month. **Dec 10 (Wed PM):** Rasmus back at house, didn't hear her last night, door closed. Rasmus asked for updated plan - awaiting response. |
| **Adam McCarthy** | Höger uppe (double/walk-through) | January 2025 | CONFIRMED LEAVING | Going to India WITH Mikael. Unlikely to stay January. Currently staying at parents to avoid Sanna ("skitjobbigt" commute). "Jobbar med mitt mående." |
| **Rasmus Kasurinen** | Vänster uppe | End of Dec / January | CONFIRMED LEAVING | Wants to move out end of Dec. Acting as "double agent" with Sanna. "Going to other adventures" |
| **Frida** | N/A | N/A | NEVER MOVED IN | Was mid-move in December, Sanna crisis hit, signed for apartment instead. "Min ångest börjar äntligen släppa så vill absolut inte se henne" |

### Who's Staying

| Name | Room | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| **Fredrik** | Master bedroom (balcony) | STAYING (trapped) | "I kind of want to leave as well... But I'm the one who will end up having to pay for two months rent" |

**Reality check:** As of Dec 10, it's "me and maaaybe Adam... Probably only me" staying in January.

### Associated People (Extended House Family)

| Name | Relationship | Potential |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Mikael** | Friend, has music studio on driveway | Going to India WITH Adam in January. "Ev nyfiken på att flytta in senare i vår" |

### Room Configuration Scenarios

**Scenario A: 4 people (3 singles + Fredrik)**
- All single rooms occupied

**Conversation History:**
| Date | Channel | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Earlier | Messenger | Initial application + scheduling |
| Dec 10 (Wed) | Phone call | "Seems lovely" but job interview timing is the blocker. Won't know until late Dec, maybe after Christmas. |
| Dec 14 (Sun) | **VIEWING SCHEDULED** | Meeting at the house |

**Next Action:** House viewing Sunday Dec 14
**Open question:** Can Fredrik wait until after Christmas for her decision? Probably not.

**KILLER ANGLE - Karolinska Proximity:**
- Karolinska Huddinge is at Hälsovägen 13, 141 57 Huddinge
- YOUR ADDRESS: 5 min walk to Stuvsta pendeltåg
- Her commute: 5 min walk → 10 min Pendeltåg to Flemingsberg → 5 min walk = **20 min total**
- She CANNOT find housing closer at this price point

**Objection Handling:**
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "What if I don't get the job?" | Flexible start - 1-month trial period available |
| "Is Huddinge too far?" | 20 min to Karolinska Huddinge - map it live on call |
| "Room quality?" | Junior doctor works long hours - room is for sleeping |

**Message Template:**
```
Hej Katarina!

Så kul att du är intresserad! Jag såg att du nämnde intervjun på
Karolinska - det är perfekt timing! Kollektivet ligger bokstavligen
5 min från Stuvsta pendeltåg, så din pendling till Karolinska Huddinge
skulle bli superenkel (~20 min totalt).

Med tanke på din eldkonst-bakgrund och yoga-intresse tror jag verkligen
du skulle gilla viben här. Vi har faktiskt pratat om att arrangera
elduppträdanden i trädgården till våren!

Är du ledig för ett 20-min samtal i veckan? Vill gärna höra mer om
din tid på folkhögskolan och visa rummet (kan göra virtuell tur om
det är enklare).

/Fredrik
```

**Call Script:**
1. Open with excitement about Karolinska interview
2. Map the commute LIVE (Google Maps share screen)
3. Fire arts connection: "Vi har velat göra eldkonst-events..."
4. Close with soft urgency: "Pratar med några andra också men du är mitt förstaval pga Karolinska-närheten"

- **Both:** Musicians, like raves/events, personal development, travel, meeting new people

- Both into personal development and meeting new people
- Potentially interested from January!

**Logistics:**
- Isabelle could move January, Jimmy later due to job

#### PROSPECT 5: Lisa's Friend (via Lisa Juntunen Roos)

**Status:** NEW - Discovered via FB scraper proof-of-concept
**Priority:** HIGH - **HOT LEAD** - Urgent need, January 1 move-in required
**Source:** Facebook post in "Lägenheter i Stockholm - Öppen grupp"

**Profile:**
- **Posted by:** Lisa Juntunen Roos (posting on behalf of friend)
- **Situation:** Single mom with 3 children, currently stands without housing from January 1
- **Work:** Works in Gustavsberg, children in förskola there
- **Transport:** No driver's license - must be reachable by public transport to Gustavsberg
- **Character:** "Otroligt driven och ansvarstagande" (incredibly driven and responsible)
- **Need:** Tillfälligt OR långsiktigt boende - just needs to "få andas ut någon gång"

**Fit Assessment:**
| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| January availability | **PERFECT** | Needs housing from Jan 1 - exact match |
| Urgency | **HIGH** | "Står utan boende" - desperate situation |
| Income stability | LIKELY | Has job in Gustavsberg |
| Kollektiv fit | UNCERTAIN | Single mom with 3 kids - may need own space |
| Commute | CHALLENGING | Gustavsberg is ~1 hour via public transport from Huddinge |

**Key Considerations:**
- **3 children** = significant space and noise factor for kollektiv
- **No car** = commute to Gustavsberg challenging (~1h via SL)
- **Desperate timing** = highly motivated, but may accept anything
- **"Tillfälligt eller långsiktigt"** = flexibility is good

**Red Flags:**
- Commute to Gustavsberg may be impractical without car
- 3 children in kollektiv setting - significant lifestyle impact
- We don't know ages of children (babies vs teenagers = very different)

**Potential Approach:**
If downstairs room could work as family room, or if willing to discuss multi-room arrangement. Would need to assess:
1. Ages of children
2. Her actual housing budget
3. Whether commute is truly feasible for her work schedule
4. How kollektiv lifestyle would work with young children

**Contact Method:** Via Lisa Juntunen Roos on Facebook (post ~1 hour old as of scraper test)

**Next Action:** Contact Lisa Juntunen Roos via Facebook to learn more about her friend's situation
**Decision Deadline:** ASAP - her need is urgent

**OPTIMAL APPROACH: "Soft Landing" Strategy**

The complexity is Gothenburg relocation + partner's job. Solution: Phase the move.

**Pitch:**
```
Hej Isabelle!

Jag förstår att Göteborgs-logistiken är komplex. Här är ett förslag:

STEG 1 (Januari):
Du tar genomgångsrummen själv (5 000 kr/mån). Detta ger dig:
- Omedelbar Stockholms-bas för din sånggig
- Tid för din partner att organisera flytten
- Testperiod för att se hur hunden integrerar

STEG 2 (Februari/Mars):
Din partner ansluter och ni övergår till par-pris
(5 000 kr/person = 10 000 kr totalt).

Så slipper ni stressa, och vi bygger förtroende gradvis.

Ska vi snacka igenom det på video i veckan? Kan visa rummen
och ni kan "träffa" huset virtuellt.

/Fredrik
```

**Dog Integration Plan:**
- January = probation period for dog behavior
- Video call to meet the dog (assess temperament)
- Clear expectations: quiet hours, outdoor bathroom routine
- Consider extra deposit for potential damage?

**Revenue Math:**
- January: 5,000 kr (solo)
- February onwards: 10,000 kr (couple)
- **6-month value: 55,000 kr** (highest single-lead ROI)

### Rejected/Declined Prospects

| Name | Reason | Date |
|------|--------|------|
| [Others from 70+ responses] | "Been cut from this list for various reasons" | TBD |

**TODO:** Document why other respondents were cut (for pattern recognition)

---

## PART 4B: HIDDEN OPPORTUNITY - THE 70+ LIKERS

### The Untapped Pool

**Context:**
- 70-80 likes across top Facebook groups
- Maybe 10-15 commented
- **60-70 people engaged but didn't apply = untapped pool**

### Why They Didn't Apply

1. **Social anxiety** - Hesitate to send first message
2. **Comparison shopping** - Saving post for later
3. **Uncertainty** - Not sure if they fit
4. **Timing** - Interested but not ready to commit yet
5. **Passive interest** - Like = bookmark, not action

### Open House Strategy (Dec 14)

**Concept:** Low-barrier event to convert fence-sitters into applicants.

**Post Template:**
```
📢 UPDATE: TOTAL OMSTART - Fortfarande 3 rum lediga

Tack för det överväldigande gensvaret! Vi har haft fantastiska
samtal och jag märker att många av er gillade/engagerade men
kanske tvekade att höra av er.

Om du är på staketet:
✅ Visning lördag 14 dec kl 14-16
✅ Öppet hus-stil - kom och träffa nuvarande/potentiella husvänner
✅ Inget åtagande, bara nyfiket mingel

Kommentera eller DM:a för adress.

De som sökt hittills inkluderar eldkonst-utövare, läkare, musiker
och yogautövare - detta formar sig till en otrolig grupp.

/Fredrik
```

**Why This Works:**
| Element | Psychology |
|---------|------------|
| "Fantastiska samtal" | Social proof + FOMO |
| "Öppet hus-stil" | Low commitment barrier |
| "Inget åtagande" | Reduces application anxiety |
| "Träffa potentiella husvänner" | Community preview |
| "Eldkonst, läkare, musiker" | Quality signaling |
| "14 dec" | Urgency trigger |

**Expected Yield:**
- 5-10 new inquiries from fence-sitters
- 2-3 additional serious prospects
- Insurance against current leads falling through

### Execution Checklist

- [ ] Post update in all 6 Facebook groups
- [ ] Prepare house for viewing (clean common areas)
- [ ] Have room info sheets ready (price, features, move-in date)
- [ ] Plan light refreshments (fika?)
- [ ] Brief Adam/anyone staying to be present and welcoming
- [ ] Collect contact info from all visitors
- [ ] Follow up within 24 hours with all attendees

---

## PART 6: HOUSE CONTRACT & LEGAL SITUATION

### Who's On The House Contract

The main lease with **BA (Bostadsagenturen)** has multiple signatories:
- **Fredrik** - still staying
- **Rasmus** - leaving, needs to be removed from contract
- **Malin** - status unclear
- **Frans** - status unclear, "lär iaf inte vara pigg på" signing new contract

**Contract situation:** To remove Rasmus, Malin + Frans + Fredrik would need to sign a new contract. Frans unlikely to agree. If only Malin + Fredrik remain, Malin also unlikely to agree.

**Fredrik's potential solution:** Take over sole responsibility for rent shortfall via separate agreement (as Rasmus suggested last week). Feels "not quite right" to sign but may have no alternative.

**Emotional reality:** Fredrik feels "lämnad i sticket" (abandoned). "Tänker aldrig driva kollektiv igen efter detta."

---

## PART 7: CONTINGENCY OPTIONS (Fredrik's Considerations)

### Option A: Find Tenants (Current Strategy)
- Fill rooms with new tenants for January
- Maintain kollektiv, continue as before
- **Status:** In progress, several leads

### Option B: AirBnB Emergency
- Run empty rooms as AirBnB for Jan/Feb
- Terminate house contract so liability is limited to Jan/Feb only
- **Mentioned:** "köra på AirBNB i jan/feb som nödlösning"

### Option C: Payment Plan + Exit
- Negotiate payment plan with BA for unpaid Jan/Feb rent
- Terminate house contract before new year
- Move to parents temporarily ("flyttar upp till mina päron tillsvidare")
- Defer costs to the future
- **Benefit:** "arbetsro" for AI work - "Jag har så mkt att vinna på att investera i allt mitt AI-arbete att arbetsro just nu är mer värt än man kanske tänker"

### Option D: Stay and Struggle
- Keep house contract
- Cover rent shortfall personally
- Hope for tenants in February
- **Risk:** 60,000 kr exposure

**Current stance:** "Det beror lite på hur det går nu med roomies iofs. Vi får se."

## PART 10B: OBJECTION HANDLING CHEAT SHEET

### Common Objections + Responses

#### 1. "Huddinge is so far from central Stockholm"

```
"Jag tänkte samma sak först tills jag kollade restiden. Du är faktiskt
18 minuter från Södermalm - samma tid som att bo i Vällingby eller
Sundbyberg, men de lägenheterna kostar 13 000 kr mot våra 7 300 kr.

Plus att Pendeltåget är mer pålitligt än tunnelbanan (färre förseningar).

Och ärligt talat? Efter en månad kommer du uppskatta att komma HEM till
natur och utrymme istället för trångt stadsliv."
```

#### 2. "What if I don't like my housemates?"

```
"Bra fråga! Vi kör 1-månads provperiod just för detta. Om det inte
funkar efter 30 dagar kan endera parten avsluta med 2 veckors varsel.

Men på 3 år har vi haft kanske 2 fall av inkompatibilitet - screening-
processen (det här samtalet!) brukar fungera bra."
```

#### 3. "Can I see the room first?"

```
"Absolut. Jag gör virtuella turer den här veckan (ons/tors kväll) och
öppet hus lördag 14 dec. Vad passar bäst?"

[Om de vill ha fysisk visning direkt]

"Kan göra en snabb visning tisdag eller fredag eftermiddag om det är
lättare - när passar för dig?"
```

#### 4. "I need to think about it"

```
"Helt förstår. Här är vad som skulle vara hjälpsamt:

1. Vilka specifika frågor/funderingar skulle hjälpa dig besluta?
2. Vad är din tidslinje för att fatta beslut?
3. Skulle det hjälpa att träffa någon av nuvarande huskompisarna?

Jag pratar med 3-4 personer den här veckan, så jag vill vara transparent -
jag kan hålla rummet till [Datum], men sen måste jag gå vidare. Rättvist?"
```

#### 5. "The rent is a bit high for me"

```
"Jag förstår - det är viktigt att det funkar ekonomiskt. Låt mig bryta ner det:

7 300 kr inkluderar: el, värme, gigabit-wifi, vatten, sopor, alla gemensamma
ytor (vardagsrum, kök, trädgård, vind).

Motsvarande etta i innerstaden: 13 000-14 000 kr + el separat.

Så du sparar faktiskt 5 000-7 000 kr/månad jämfört med marknadspris,
PLUS du får community och gemenskap på köpet.

Men jag vill vara ärlig - om budgeten är tight kanske kollektiv inte är
rätt just nu. Ekonomisk stabilitet är viktigt för alla."
```

#### 6. "I have a pet / want to get a pet"

```
"Vi är öppna för husdjur - beror på vilken typ och hur det skulle
fungera med huset. Berätta mer om ditt djur?

[Assess: Dog vs cat vs other. Size. Behavior. Outdoor needs.]

Vad vi behöver veta:
- Hur gammal/aktiv är djuret?
- Hur hanterar det att vara ensam hemma?
- Några beteendeutmaningar vi bör veta om?

Vi kan diskutera eventuell extra deposition om det känns relevant."

## APPENDICES

### Appendix A: Full Ad Text

```
TOTAL OMSTART: 3-4 RUM LEDIGA · INFLYTT 1 JAN · VILLAKOLLEKTIV I HUDDINGE

För prick 3 år sedan grundade vi detta kreativa sprakiga kollektiv, som gått igenom så många olika eror. Jag har vid några tillfällen stått på uppfarten och fällt tårar när jag mints alla fina stunder som ägt rum här. Det har hållit mitt liv och jag har fått vänner för livet.

Efter några twists & turns under hösten har vi nått ett monumentalt vägskäl - därför söker jag nu med ljus och lykta i vintern efter 3-4 nya medlemmar för att bo tillsammans under detta tak.

Adam åker tillbaka till Indien och Rasmus går vidare till andra äventyr. Tidigare medlemmar och vänner från vår extended house family lär hälsa på då och då. Som kollektivpappa välkomnar jag varmt varje ny person att sätta sin prägel på huset och vår delade tillvaro. För mig är det viktigaste att viben känns rätt mellan oss som tar över tyglarna och att vi delar en intention att skapa en trygg & tillitsfull gemenskap.

Vår 170 kvm villa (byggd 1905) har fått husera filmkvällar, circling, improvisations‑jam, arts‑&‑crafts‑projekt, middagar, spontana söndagsvåfflor, danspauser, gemensamma meditationer, naturutflykter och springturer i naturreservatet. Humor, hjärta och ärlig kommunikation har hållit oss samman.

Hyran är ca 7 300 kr/månad ­– varierar 6 000–7 900 kr över året beroende på elförbrukningen. Om ett dubbelrum kan delas på 2 så kan vi bo 5 totalt och därmed betala ca en tusenlapp mindre per person.

Deposition 6 200 kr + 2 200 kr som är vår delade ägarandel i möbler, växter & prylar medan du bor i kollektivet. När du flyttar får du beloppet tillbaka av den som flyttar in efter dig, precis som med depositionen.

VILKA ÄR VI?

- Fredrik – lugn och stadig filosofisk tech‑wizard & ljuskonst‑byggare på Borderland, HSP/känslosam, söker syntes mellan andlighet och vetenskap, erfaren kodare, AI-nörd
- Adam – sjuksköterska med reslust, spirituellt intresserad, spelar indisk flöjt & gitarr på terrassen i kvällssolen (Adam flyttar ut i januari, återvänder möjligen senare i vår)
- Mikael – har sin musikstudio på hjul parkerad på uppfarten, gemensam vän till mig och Adam (reser också till Indien i januari, är ev nyfiken på att flytta in senare i vår)

HUSET & LÄGET

- Ljusa sovrum med t ex inbyggda bokhyllor, kakelugn och mycket charm + stora mysiga sociala ytor
- Stor trädgård med äppelträd, uteplats och egen eldplats – mys runt lågorna när kvällsluften blir sval
- Naturreservat 800 m bort; pendeln finns 5 min promenad bort och tar dig till Södermalm på 18 min
- Välutrustat kök med lyxig gasspis, diskmaskin, välordnad sopsortering, vi delar på matlagningsoljor, kryddor osv
- Gott om förvaring, gigabit-wifi inkluderat, rymlig tvättstuga & verkstad, badkar med tassar och chillspace på vinden

VEM SÖKER VI?

Vi har sen kollektivet skapades haft, och uppskattat, ett brett mångfald av perspektiv och uttryck hos våra medlemmar. Det känns viktigt att du:

- Har erfarenhet och förståelse för vad det innebär att gemensamt ta hand om ett hem tillsammans med andra människor (plocka, städa, fixa, och kompromissa)
- Hittar energi i gemenskap, gärna ibland vardagsumgås inom kollektivet och är intresserad av att ibland samskapa events där vi bjuder in vänner (musik-jams, middagar, fester)
- Är tolerant och öppensinnad för folks olikheter, styrkor och utmaningar
- Har en stark inre ro men också ett intresse av kreativt uttryck, kommunikation, andlig utveckling och djupare samtal och möten
- Ekonomisk stabilitet är viktigt; vi ser boendet som en investering i livskvalitet snarare än ett lågprisalternativ.

LÅTER DET HÄR SOM DITT NÄSTA HEM?

Skicka ett meddelande och berätta lite om dig själv och hur du tror att du kan bidra till vår gemenskap.

Ser fram emot att höra din story och kanske välkomna dig till Kimono Kittens i det nya året ✨
