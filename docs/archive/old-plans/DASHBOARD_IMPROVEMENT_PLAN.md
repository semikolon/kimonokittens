# Dashboard Improvement Plan - September 22, 2025

## Current Status: 4% context remaining
Both servers running successfully:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5175 (npm run dev)
- Backend: http://localhost:3001 (ENABLE_BROADCASTER=1 ruby puma_server.rb)

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS
1. **Reduce time text size by 10-20%** - Changed from `text-[14rem]` to `text-[12rem]`
2. **Ensure Hem and Klimat widgets are same-ish width** - Both use 1 column in 4-column grid
3. **Ensure Strava widget text never wraps** - Given 2 columns (50% width)
4. **Make temperature colors more subdued** - Changed from -400 to -300 classes
5. **Use better monochrome icons** - Updated to üå¢ (humidity), üå¨ (wind), ‚¨° (air quality)
6. **Remove redundant 'resor' title** - Removed from travel widget
7. **Remove emoji from running stats** - Cleaned up StravaWidget
8. **Train and bus times side by side** - Grid layout in TrainWidget
9. **Remove duplicate Swedish headers** - Cleaned up widget titles

## üöß IN PROGRESS TASKS

### 1. Fix Time Text Color (URGENT)
**Current Issue**: Purple too bright (`text-purple-300`)
**Required**: Darker, more saturated purple matching logo colors
**Solution**: Need to check logo files and use similar color like `text-purple-600` or custom color

### 2. Fix Time/Date Text Overlap (URGENT)
**Current**: Time uses `text-[12rem] mb-12`
**Issue**: Still might overlap on some screen sizes
**Solution**: Increase margin-bottom or adjust line height

## üìã PENDING CRITICAL TASKS

### 3. Fix Dynamic Full-Width Layout (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Page layout still appears fixed-width, not dynamic
**Root Cause**: Need to investigate container constraints
**Current Layout**: `div className="w-full px-6 py-12"`
**Required**: Truly responsive full-width layout

### 4. Make Widgets Resize Dynamically
**Current Grid**: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4`
**Layout**: Hem(1) + Strava(2) + Klimat(1) = 4 columns
**Required**: Ensure responsive behavior on all screen sizes

## üîß IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **First**: Fix time text color to match logo purple
2. **Second**: Verify no time/date overlap
3. **Third**: Take screenshot to verify changes
4. **Fourth**: Fix dynamic layout width constraints
5. **Continue**: Iterative improvement with frequent screenshots

## üìÅ KEY FILES MODIFIED

### Frontend (dashboard/src/)
- `components/ClockWidget.tsx` - Time display with purple color and spacing
- `components/WeatherWidget.tsx` - Subdued colors and monochrome icons
- `components/StravaWidget.tsx` - Removed emoji, simplified content
- `components/TrainWidget.tsx` - Side-by-side train/bus layout
- `App.tsx` - Grid layout (4-column: 1+2+1), removed redundant titles

### Backend
- `puma_server.rb` - Successfully migrated from Agoo, WebSocket working
- All handlers functional with real-time data broadcasting

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES
- Logo files location: Need to check `/logo.png` for color reference
- Original dashboard aesthetic: Monochrome, clean, professional
- User wants iterative improvement with frequent screenshots
- Never stop until highly satisfied with result
- All changes should maintain real-time data functionality

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Time text: Proper purple color matching logo
- [ ] Layout: Truly dynamic, full-width, responsive
- [ ] No text overlap anywhere
- [ ] Professional monochrome aesthetic maintained
- [ ] All real-time data flowing correctly
- [ ] No line wrapping in Strava stats
