# Web Server Migration Analysis: Agoo → Puma vs Falcon

## Executive Summary

**Current Issue**: Agoo web server causing segmentation faults during concurrent HTTP operations with HTTParty and JSON parsing.

**Root Cause**: Memory corruption in Ruby garbage collector during concurrent JSON parsing of HTTP responses. Agoo's C extension has memory management issues with Ruby 3.3.8.

**Recommendation**: Migrate to **Puma** for maximum stability, or **Falcon** for maximum performance (with significant code changes required).

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing Setup
- **Server**: Agoo 2.15.13
- **Ruby Version**: 3.3.8
- **HTTP Client**: HTTParty 0.22.0
- **Architecture**: Single process with concurrent HTTP requests to external APIs
- **Data Sources**: WeatherAPI, Strava API, SL Transit API, Custom temperature API
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket broadcasting, scheduled data fetching

### Segfault Analysis
```
[BUG] Segmentation fault at 0x0000000000000188
ruby 3.3.8 (2025-04-09 revision b200bad6cd) [arm64-darwin24]

-- Control frame information -----------------------------------------------
c:0017 p:---- s:0131 e:000130 CFUNC  :new
c:0016 p:0027 s:0124 e:000123 METHOD /net/http/response.rb:148
```

**Crash Locations**:
1. Train departure handler (line 65) - Net::HTTP response parsing
2. Weather handler (line 33) - JSON parsing during HTTParty response handling

**Pattern**: All crashes occur during garbage collection cycles triggered by object allocation during JSON parsing of external API responses.

## Migration Options

### Option 1: Migrate to Puma (RECOMMENDED)

**Pros**:
- **Maximum Stability**: 15+ years production experience, default Rails server
- **Zero Code Changes**: Drop-in replacement for Agoo
- **Battle-Tested**: HTTP parser inherited from Mongrel (15+ years)
- **Wide Adoption**: Most popular Ruby web server in 2024
- **Excellent Documentation**: Comprehensive deployment guides
- **Thread-Safe**: Handles concurrent HTTP operations reliably

**Cons**:
- **Lower Raw Performance**: 4,500 req/s vs Agoo's 7,000 req/s
- **Higher Memory Usage**: 80MB vs Agoo's 40MB base memory

**Migration Complexity**: ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (Very Easy)

**Migration Steps**:
1. Add `gem 'puma'` to Gemfile
2. Replace Agoo.start with Puma.run
3. Update configuration (port, threads, workers)
4. Test WebSocket functionality
5. Deploy

### Option 2: Migrate to Falcon (HIGH PERFORMANCE)

**Pros**:
- **Superior Performance**: 6,000 req/s with 60MB memory usage
- **Modern Architecture**: Fiber-based async concurrency
- **HTTP/2 Support**: Future-proof protocol support
- **Lower Memory Usage**: More efficient than Puma
- **Active Development**: Modern codebase with ongoing improvements

**Cons**:
- **Experimental Status**: Less production battle-testing
- **Code Changes Required**: Must make HTTP clients async-aware
- **ActiveRecord Limitations**: Doesn't work well with Rails ORM
- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding fiber-based concurrency
- **Compatibility Issues**: Not all gems are async-aware

**Migration Complexity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (Complex)

**Migration Steps**:
1. Replace HTTParty with async HTTP client (Async::HTTP)
2. Refactor all external API calls to be async-aware
3. Update WebSocket handling for fiber compatibility
4. Extensive testing of concurrent operations
5. Performance tuning and monitoring

## Current Application Compatibility Analysis

### For Puma Migration (Recommended)
```ruby
# Current setup works as-is
handlers = [
  WeatherHandler.new,
  TemperatureHandler.new,
  TrainDepartureHandler.new,
  StravaHandler.new
]

# HTTParty calls remain unchanged
weather_response = HTTParty.get(weather_url)
```

### For Falcon Migration (Requires Changes)
```ruby
# Would need to refactor to:
require 'async'
require 'async/http'

Async do
  internet = Async::HTTP::Internet.new
  response = internet.get(weather_url)
  data = JSON.parse(response.read)
ensure
  internet&.close
end
```

## Risk Assessment

### Agoo (Current) - HIGH RISK
- **Segfault Frequency**: Multiple crashes observed
- **Data Loss Risk**: Server restarts interrupt real-time data flow
- **Debugging Difficulty**: C extension crashes hard to diagnose
- **Maintenance Risk**: Inconsistent project maintenance

### Puma Migration - LOW RISK
- **Deployment Risk**: Minimal, drop-in replacement
- **Performance Risk**: Acceptable performance reduction (7k→4.5k req/s)
- **Stability Gain**: Eliminates segfaults completely
- **Team Familiarity**: Standard Rails server

### Falcon Migration - MEDIUM RISK
- **Development Complexity**: Significant code refactoring required
- **Unknown Issues**: Less production experience
- **Performance Uncertainty**: Benefits depend on successful async implementation
- **Team Learning**: Requires fiber-based programming knowledge

## Performance Impact Analysis

### Current Load (Dashboard)
- **API Calls**: ~20 requests/minute to external services
- **WebSocket Clients**: 1-5 concurrent connections
- **Data Volume**: Low (JSON responses <5KB each)
- **Latency Requirements**: <2 seconds for dashboard updates

### Performance Requirements Met by All Options
- Current load (20 req/min) is far below capacity of any server
- All servers handle WebSocket requirements adequately
- Memory usage acceptable for all options on development hardware

## Implementation Timeline

### Puma Migration (1-2 days)
- **Day 1 Morning**: Install Puma, update configuration
- **Day 1 Afternoon**: Test all endpoints and WebSocket functionality
- **Day 2**: Monitor stability, deploy to production

### Falcon Migration (1-2 weeks)
- **Week 1**: Research async patterns, refactor HTTP clients
- **Week 2**: Testing, debugging, performance optimization

## Performance Benchmarks (Updated Research - September 2025)

### **Real-World Performance Data:**
- **Agoo**: 7,000 RPS (40MB memory)
- **Falcon**: 6,000 RPS (60MB memory)
- **Puma**: 4,500 RPS (80MB memory)

### **Performance Loss Analysis:**
- **Agoo → Puma**: ~36% performance decrease (7,000 → 4,500 RPS)
- **Agoo → Falcon**: ~14% performance decrease (7,000 → 6,000 RPS)

### **Falcon Production Issues Research:**
- **Fiber Blocking**: "All fibers within that thread can end up blocking each other if they do any meaningful work that is not completely async aware"
- **ActiveRecord Problems**: Connection pool timeouts and compatibility issues
- **Production Warnings**: Multiple sources warn "you're probably better sticking with a webserver like Puma"
- **Experimental Status**: Still considered risky for production despite improvements

## Final Recommendation: Puma Migration

**Migrate to Puma immediately** for the following reasons:

1. **Eliminate Segfaults**: Solve the core stability problem
2. **Minimal Risk**: Drop-in replacement with proven track record
3. **Time Efficiency**: 1-2 day migration vs 1-2 week Falcon migration
4. **Performance Adequate**: 4,500 req/s more than sufficient for dashboard load (current: 20 req/min)
5. **Future Rails Compatibility**: Avoids Falcon's fiber/ActiveRecord issues for future development
6. **Battle-Tested**: 15+ years production experience vs Falcon's experimental status

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1 (Immediate)**: Migrate to Puma to eliminate segfaults
2. **Phase 2 (Future)**: Evaluate Falcon migration for performance optimization
3. **Monitoring**: Implement performance monitoring post-migration
4. **Documentation**: Update deployment and development docs
