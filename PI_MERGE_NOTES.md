## Kimono Kittens – Pi Snapshot vs GitHub Repo

_Last updated: 2025-06-20_

### Summary of merge session (2025-06-20)

This document records the complete merge process from the `kimonokittens_pi/` backup directory into the main GitHub repository. **All valuable content has been successfully preserved and merged.**

### 1 Initial state analysis

| Aspect | `kimonokittens/` (GitHub) | `kimonokittens_pi/` (Pi backup) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Version control | Standard Git repo | Plain directory (no VCS, snapshot from June 1, 2024) |
| Web server start-up | Thin 60-line `json_server.rb` that **requires** individual handler files | One 559-line `json_server.rb` with every handler inlined plus server boot |
| Handlers present | 8 Ruby files in `handlers/` (adds **BankBuster** and **RentAndFinances**) | Same handler logic but embedded; no BankBuster / RentAndFinances |
| Extra scripts | Specs, backups, frontend, etc. | `tv-cast/`, `count_*`, job-scraper scripts, huge `cron_log.log` |
| Data files | Smaller, trimmed JSON snapshots | Large historical JSON (≈250 kB electricity), logs |
| Gemfile | Adds `ox`, `table_print`, `puffing-billy`, `google-apis-sheets_v4`, `ferrum`, … | Earlier, slimmer dependency set |

### 2 Handler code comparison (detailed analysis)

**Comprehensive diff results:**

| Handler | Status | Changes made |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ElectricityStatsHandler` | **Identical logic**. Pi version had variable name `electricity_stats` vs repo `electricity_usage`, and explicit `consumption ||= 0.0` nil-safety. | **No changes needed** - repo already had the nil-safety fix |
| `TrainDepartureHandler` | **Byte-for-byte identical** between repo and Pi. | None |
| `StravaWorkoutsHandler` | **Byte-for-byte identical** between repo and Pi. | None |
| `ProxyHandler` | **IP address mismatch** – Pi used `192.168.4.66`, repo used `192.168.0.210`. | **✅ Fixed**: Updated repo to use `192.168.4.66` (correct Pi network) |
| `StaticHandler` / `HomePageHandler` | Identical. | None |
| `BankBusterHandler`, `RentAndFinancesHandler` | **Only in repo** (newer functionality post-Pi). | None |

### 3 Server configuration comparison

**Non-handler parts of `json_server.rb`:**
- **Agoo server setup**: Identical SSL configuration, logging, port binding
- **Route definitions**: Pi missing newer routes (`/ws`, `/data/rent_and_finances`) but otherwise identical
- **Handler instantiation**: Pi creates 6 handlers, repo creates 8 handlers
- **Result**: No server configuration changes needed - Pi version was just missing newer features

### 4 Files migrated and organized

#### ✅ **Configuration files**
- **`config/schedule.rb`**: Copied from Pi with improvements (better comments, preserved original cron line as reference)
- **`.bashrc`**: Copied to repo root, **committed to Git** (rbenv setup for deployment)
- **Gemfile verification**: `whenever` gem already present in repo

#### ✅ **Working files** (repo root, Git-ignored)
- **`.env`**: Copied from Pi (contains Vattenfall credentials, SSN) 
- **`.refresh_token`**: Copied from Pi (Strava OAuth token)

#### ✅ **Data archive** (`data/archive/`, Git-ignored)
- **`electricity_usage.json`**: 247KB historical data from Pi
- **`tibber_price_data.json`**: 29KB price data from Pi  
- **`cron_log.log`**: 11MB Pi operation logs
- **`.env-pi-backup`**: Backup copy of Pi environment file

#### ✅ **Project separation**
- **`tv-cast-backup/`**: Moved Pi's minimal tv-cast to root level (separate from main tv-cast repo)

### 5 Git ignore updates

Added to `.gitignore`:
```
cron_log.log
data/archive/
```

### 6 Unique Pi content preserved externally

**Utility scripts** (not needed in main repo):
- `count_chromium.sh`, `count_processes.rb` - Pi monitoring scripts
- `job_scraper_*` - Job scraping experiments  
- `tv-stream.js` - TV streaming utility
- `json_server_old.rb` - Legacy server version

**Operations files**:
- `json_server_daemon.service` - Systemd service definition (Pi-specific)

### 7 Safety verification completed

**Hidden files audit:**
- `.ruby-version` (3.1.0 vs repo 3.2.2) - repo version kept  
- `.bashrc` - **migrated to repo**
- `.env` - **migrated to repo** + backup in archive
- `.refresh_token` - **migrated to repo**

**Comprehensive diff verification:**
- All handler logic compared line-by-line ✓
- Server configuration compared comprehensively ✓  
- No valuable code or configuration lost ✓

### 8 Final status

**✅ MERGE COMPLETE - Pi snapshot can be safely deleted**

All valuable content from `kimonokittens_pi/` has been:
- **Code**: Merged or verified identical
- **Configuration**: Migrated and improved  
- **Data**: Archived locally (Git-ignored)
- **Working files**: Positioned correctly in repo
- **External projects**: Backed up separately

**Ready for production**: The repo now contains all Pi functionality with improvements:
- Correct network configuration (ProxyHandler IP)
- Better documentation (schedule.rb comments)
- Proper file organization (archive strategy)
- Complete development environment setup (.bashrc)
