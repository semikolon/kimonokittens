## üöÄ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT - Dell Optiplex Kiosk [IN PROGRESS]

**Goal:** Deploy Kimonokittens dashboard as production kiosk on Dell Optiplex

**Status:** Webhook functional, awaiting vite installation fix

### **Current Status** (October 2, 2025)
- ‚úÖ **Webhook server:** Running on port 49123, receiving GitHub events
- ‚úÖ **Ping events:** Responding with 200 OK
- ‚úÖ **Push events:** Accepting both JSON and form-encoded payloads
- ‚úÖ **Debouncing:** 2-minute delay prevents deployment spam
- ‚úÖ **Smart analysis:** Only deploys changed components (frontend/backend)
- ‚ùå **BLOCKER:** Frontend builds fail - vite not installed despite `npm ci`

### **Critical Issue: NPM Workspace DevDependencies**
**Problem:** Running `npm ci` from workspace root installs 200 packages but vite is missing
**Impact:** All frontend deployments fail at build step
**Investigation:** npm workspaces + devDependencies interaction issue
**Next Steps:**
- Research why vite (in `dashboard/package.json` devDependencies) isn't installed
- Consider adding vite to root package.json devDependencies
- Test npm install vs npm ci behavior
- Evaluate Capistrano or modern deployment alternatives

### **Production Environment Setup**
- [x] **Run production deployment script**
- [x] **Configure GitHub webhook** (ID: 572892196, port 49123)
- [x] **Test webhook:** Working - `http://DELL_IP:49123/webhook`
- [ ] **Fix vite installation** - CRITICAL BLOCKER
- [ ] **Verify services:** `systemctl status kimonokittens-dashboard nginx`
- [ ] **Test end-to-end deployment:** Push ‚Üí webhook ‚Üí build ‚Üí deploy
- [ ] **Reboot for kiosk mode:** `sudo reboot`

### **Production Architecture** (SIMPLIFIED)
- **User:** `kimonokittens` (single user for backend + kiosk display)
- **Ruby:** 3.3.8 via rbenv (copied to production user)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with production data migration
- **Frontend:** Nginx serving built dashboard
- **Auto-updates:** GitHub webhook ‚Üí deployment script

### **Critical Blocker: Dotfiles Setup**
- [ ] **Locate and sync global Claude config** from Mac Mini M2
- [ ] **Setup dotfiles repository** with symlink strategy for `.zshrc`, `.claude/`
- [ ] **Add rbenv Claude Code compatibility section** to global CLAUDE.md:
  ```markdown
  ## Claude Code & rbenv Compatibility
  Claude Code Bash tool doesn't load shell functions. Use direct paths:

  # ‚ùå Won't work: rbenv exec ruby --version
  # ‚úÖ Works: ~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv exec ruby --version
  ```
- [ ] **Create bootstrap script** for consistent machine setup
- [ ] **Document dotfiles structure** and deployment process

**Priority**: HIGH - Affects all future Claude Code sessions and development workflow
**Details**: See `deployment/DOTFILES_SETUP_BLOCKER.md`

**References:**
- `deployment/README.md` (quick start guide)
- `deployment/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (step-by-step)

## üåô Dashboard Sleep Schedule Feature ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY

**Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY WORKING with CSS transitions (October 4, 2025)

### Implemented Features
- ‚úÖ **File-based configuration** at `config/sleep_schedule.json` (git-tracked, vim-editable)
- ‚úÖ **Smooth GPU-accelerated fades**: Pure CSS transitions (120s opacity, cubic-bezier easing)
- ‚úÖ **Weekend support**: Different sleep times for Fri/Sat nights (sleepTimeWeekend)
- ‚úÖ **Adaptive brightness**: 24-hour schedule (0.7-1.5 range) integrated with xrandr
- ‚úÖ **Monitor power control**: DPMS power off during sleep (optional via config)
- ‚úÖ **Animation pausing**: WebGL shader and CSS animations pause during sleep
- ‚úÖ **Webhook auto-reload**: Config changes trigger kiosk browser reload

### Current Configuration
Located at `config/sleep_schedule.json`:
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "sleepTime": "01:00",           // Weekday: 1am
  "sleepTimeWeekend": "03:00",    // Fri/Sat: 3am
  "wakeTime": "05:30",            // Every day: 5:30am
  "monitorPowerControl": true,
  "brightnessEnabled": true
}
```

### Components Deployed
- **Backend API**: `/api/sleep/config` (handlers/sleep_schedule_handler.rb)
- **Frontend Context**: SleepScheduleContext.tsx (state machine, 10s timer)
- **UI Components**: FadeOverlay.tsx (pure CSS transitions, no JS animation)
- **Display Control**: display_control_handler.rb (xrandr brightness + DPMS)

### Key Implementation Fix (Oct 4, 2025)
**Bug Found**: Original requestAnimationFrame approach conflicted with CSS transitions
**Fix Applied**: Pure CSS `transition: opacity 120s` - GPU-accelerated, smooth fades
**Time Check**: Reduced to 10s interval to prevent missing minute boundaries

### Testing Status
- [x] CSS fade-out works smoothly (2-minute transition)
- [x] CSS fade-in works smoothly (2-minute transition)
- [x] Weekend schedule uses correct sleep time
- [x] Time check interval catches minute boundaries
- [x] End-to-end overnight sleep/wake cycle (Verified Oct 4, 2025)
- [x] Monitor DPMS power control verification (Verified Oct 4, 2025)

**Details:** See `docs/DASHBOARD_SLEEP_SCHEDULE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for architecture

## Immediate Tasks & Repository Hygiene

**Goal:** Address outstanding technical debt and improve overall code quality.

-   [ ] **Test ViewTransition animations** (manual browser verification)
    -   [ ] Verify train intro/departure animations (5s slide-in, 400ms slide-out)
    -   [ ] Verify bus intro/departure animations
    -   [ ] Verify warning/critical glows still trigger correctly
    -   [ ] Check delay display (no "0m sen" regression)
    -   [ ] Monitor performance marks in console (should be <50ms)
    -   **Details:** See `docs/VIEWTRANSITION_SESSION_STATE.md` for complete implementation summary
    -   **Commits:** 13 commits (0b7d1e7 and earlier) - ~278 lines removed, native browser API
-   [ ] **Fix Failing Specs: [In Progress]**
    -   [ ] **BankBuster:** All 5 specs for `bank_buster_spec.rb` are failing.
    -   [ ] **HandbookHandler:** All 12 specs for `handbook_handler_spec.rb` are failing.
-   [ ] **Decide fate of BankBuster: modernise or archive**
-   [ ] **Add fast spec for handler timeouts/fallbacks**
-   [ ] **See handoff_to_claude_git_proposal_workflow.md for proposal workflow plan**
-   [ ] **See handoff_to_claude_rspec_tests.md for remaining handler/spec coverage items**
-   [ ] **Add/complete specs for new handler logic (timeouts/fallbacks) and frontend widget tests**

# SL API Note
- SL train departures currently use fallback data due to missing accessId. See DEVELOPMENT.md and TODO.md for next steps.

# WebSocket Integration
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: DataBroadcaster now uses `ENV['API_BASE_URL']` for all endpoints
- Configured in `.env` for development and systemd service for production
- All endpoints (rent_data, todo_data, train_data, etc.) use configurable base URL

## Phase 1: Foundational Data Structures

**Goal:** Define the core data models for the handbook before any code is written.

- [x] **Task 1.1: Define Prisma Schema**
    - [x] Finalize `RentLedger` based on the newly merged rent calculation logic.
    - [x] Added `startDate` to `Tenant` model.

---

## Phase 2: Handbook Frontend Scaffolding

**Goal:** Create a functional, non-interactive frontend shell with all necessary libraries and components.

- [x] **Task 2.6: Create `<RentPanel/>` component.**

---

## Phase 3-7: Backend, AI, & Core Logic (Pending)

**Goal:** Implement the full approval workflow, AI query pipeline, and other production features.

- [ ] **(AI) Task 7.1: Implement Git-Backed Approval Workflow**
    - [ ] Add the `rugged` gem to the `Gemfile` for Git operations from Ruby.
    - [ ] Modify the `HandbookHandler` to create a new branch (e.g., `proposal/some-change`) when a proposal is submitted.
    - [ ] On approval, use `rugged` to merge the proposal branch into `master`.
    - [ ] **Conflict-Safety:** Implement a "dry-run" merge check to detect potential conflicts before enabling the merge button in the UI. The UI should show a warning if conflicts are found.
- [ ] Set up proper authentication and user management.
- [ ] **(USER)** Set up voice assistant hardware (Dell Optiplex, Google Homes).
- [ ] And other tasks from the original plan...

---

## Phase 3: Backend & AI Pipeline Scaffolding

**Goal:** Define the backend API contract with mock data and build the script to populate our AI's knowledge 
base.

- [x] **(AI) Task 3.1: Add `pinecone-client` to Gemfile**
    - [x] Edit the root `Gemfile` and add `gem 'pinecone-client', '~> 0.1'`.
    - [x] Run `bundle install` in the terminal.
- [x] **(AI) Task 3.2: Scaffold API Routes**
    - [x] Edit `json_server.rb`. Add a new handler class at the end of the file.
      ```ruby
      class HandbookHandler < WEBrick::HTTPServlet::AbstractServlet
        def do_GET(req, res)
          res['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
          
          # Mock API for fetching a single page
          if req.path.match(%r{/api/handbook/pages/(\w+)})
            slug = $1
            res.body = {
              title: "Mock Page: #{slug.capitalize}",
              content: "<h1>#{slug.capitalize}</h1><p>This is mock content for the page.</p>"
            }.to_json
            return
          end

          # Mock API for fetching proposals
          if req.path == '/api/handbook/proposals'
            res.body = [
              { id: 1, title: 'Proposal 1', author: 'Fredrik' },
              { id: 2, title: 'Proposal 2', author: 'Rasmus' }
            ].to_json
            return
          end

          res.status = 404
          res.body = { error: 'Not Found' }.to_json
        end
        
        def do_POST(req, res)
            # Mock API for creating a proposal
            if req.path == '/api/handbook/proposals'
                puts "Received proposal: #{req.body}"
                res['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
                res.body = { status: 'success', message: 'Proposal received' }.to_json
                return
            end
            
            res.status = 404
            res.body = { error: 'Not Found' }.to_json
        end
      end
      ```
    - [x] In `json_server.rb`, find where other handlers are mounted (e.g., `server.mount "/api/...", ...`) a
nd add the new handler:
      ```ruby
      server.mount "/api/handbook", HandbookHandler
      ```
- [x] **(AI) Task 3.3: Implement RAG Indexing Script**
    - [x] Create `handbook/scripts/index_documents.rb` with the following content. This script connects to Pi
necone and indexes the content of our handbook documents.
      ```ruby
      require 'pinecone'
      require 'dotenv/load'

      # Configuration
      PINECONE_INDEX_NAME = 'kimonokittens-handbook'
      DOCS_PATH = File.expand_path('../../docs', __FILE__)
      # Standard dimension for OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002
      VECTOR_DIMENSION = 1536 

      def init_pinecone
        Pinecone.configure do |config|
          config.api_key  = ENV.fetch('PINECONE_API_KEY')
          # NOTE: The environment for Pinecone is found in the Pinecone console
          # It's usually something like "gcp-starter" or "us-west1-gcp"
          config.environment = ENV.fetch('PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT') 
        end
      end

      def main
        init_pinecone
        pinecone = Pinecone::Client.new
        
        # 1. Create index if it doesn't exist
        unless pinecone.index(PINECONE_INDEX_NAME).describe_index_stats.success?
          puts "Creating Pinecone index '#{PINECONE_INDEX_NAME}'..."
          pinecone.create_index(
            name: PINECONE_INDEX_NAME,
            dimension: VECTOR_DIMENSION,
            metric: 'cosine'
          )
        end
        index = pinecone.index(PINECONE_INDEX_NAME)

        # 2. Read documents and prepare vectors
        vectors_to_upsert = []
        Dir.glob("#{DOCS_PATH}/*.md").each do |file_path|
          puts "Processing #{File.basename(file_path)}..."
          content = File.read(file_path)
          
          # Split content into chunks (by paragraph)
          chunks = content.split("\n\n").reject(&:empty?)
          
          chunks.each_with_index do |chunk, i|
            # FAKE EMBEDDING: In a real scenario, you would call an embedding API here.
            # For now, we generate a random vector.
            fake_embedding = Array.new(VECTOR_DIMENSION) { rand(-1.0..1.0) }
            
            vectors_to_upsert << {
              id: "#{File.basename(file_path, '.md')}-#{i}",
              values: fake_embedding,
              metadata: {
                file: File.basename(file_path),
                text: chunk[0..200] # Store a snippet of the text
              }
            }
          end
        end
        
        # 3. Upsert vectors to Pinecone
        puts "Upserting #{vectors_to_upsert.length} vectors to Pinecone..."
        index.upsert(vectors: vectors_to_upsert)
        puts "Done!"
      end

      main if __FILE__ == $0
      ```
    - [x] Add a note to the user: A `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT` variable will need to be added to the environment 
for the script to run.

---

- [x] **(AI) Task 4.1: Enhance the Mock Backend to be Stateful**
    - [x] Edit `handlers/handbook_handler.rb` at the top of the `HandbookHandler` class to initialize: `@prop
osals = []` and `@next_proposal_id = 1`.
    - [x] Modify `do_POST` on `/api/handbook/proposals` to parse JSON, create proposal hash with `{ id: @next
_proposal_id, title: "Proposal for #{Time.now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}", content: parsed_body['content'], approv
als: 0 }`, add to array, increment ID, return new proposal as JSON.
    - [x] Modify `do_GET` on `/api/handbook/proposals` to return the `@proposals` array as JSON.
    - [x] Add route for `POST /api/handbook/proposals/(\d+)/approve` that finds proposal by ID, increments `:
approvals` count, returns updated proposal as JSON.
- [x] **(AI) Task 4.2: Build Frontend UI for Proposals**
    - [x] Create `handbook/frontend/src/components/ProposalList.tsx` that fetches from `/api/handbook/proposa
ls`, stores in `useState`, maps over proposals to show title/approval count, has "Approve" button that POSTs 
to approve endpoint.
    - [x] Create `handbook/frontend/src/components/Editor.tsx` using TipTap's `useEditor` hook with `StarterK
it`, renders `EditToolbar` and `EditorContent`, has "Save Proposal" button that POSTs `editor.getHTML()` to `
/api/handbook/proposals`.
    - [x] Update `handbook/frontend/src/App.tsx` to remove default Vite content, add state for showing WikiPa
ge vs Editor, render ProposalList component always visible.

## Phase 5: AI Query Implementation

**Goal:** Connect the RAG pipeline to a real UI, using a real embedding model and LLM.

- [x] **(AI) Task 5.1: Update RAG Script for Real Embeddings**
    - [x] Add `ruby-openai` gem to Gemfile and run `bundle install`.
    - [x] Edit `handbook/scripts/index_documents.rb` to initialize OpenAI client, replace fake embeddings wit
h real API calls to `text-embedding-3-small`, add error handling and rate limiting.
- [x] **(AI) Task 5.2: Create AI Query Backend Endpoint**
    - [x] Edit `handlers/handbook_handler.rb` to add route for `POST /api/handbook/query` that: parses questi
on, embeds it, queries Pinecone for top results, constructs prompt with context, calls OpenAI chat completion
, returns AI response.
- [x] **(AI) Task 5.3: Build Frontend UI for AI Queries**
    - [x] Create `handbook/frontend/src/components/QueryInterface.tsx` with text input, submit button, loadin
g state, displays AI answer.
    - [x] Update `handbook/frontend/src/App.tsx` to include QueryInterface component.

## Phase 6: Testing

**Goal:** Ensure the application is robust and reliable with a comprehensive test suite.

- [x] **(AI) Task 6.1: Implement Backend Specs**
    - [x] Add `rspec` and `rack-test` to the Gemfile.
    - [x] Create `spec/handbook_handler_spec.rb` to test the mock API, covering proposal CRUD, approvals, and
 mocked AI queries.
- [x] **(AI) Task 6.2: Implement Frontend Specs**
    - [x] Add `vitest` and `@testing-library/react` to `package.json`.
    - [x] Configure Vite for testing with a `jsdom` environment.
    - [x] Create unit tests for `WikiPage` and `ProposalList` components.

## Phase 7: Core Logic Implementation

  - **Peak pricing (53.60 √∂re/kWh)**: Mon-Fri 06:00-22:00 during Jan/Feb/Mar/Nov/Dec
  - **Off-peak pricing (21.40 √∂re/kWh)**: All other times + entire summer (Apr-Oct)
  - **Impact**: ~400-500 kr/month savings potential by shifting consumption to off-peak
  - **Priority 1**: Update `ElectricityProjector` with hour-of-day + month-of-year logic
  - **Priority 2**: Migrate Node-RED heatpump schedule from Tibber API to elprisetjustnu.se API
  - **Priority 3**: Implement smart scheduling to avoid 06:00-22:00 weekdays in winter months
  - **Technical**: Add peak/off-peak classification to consumption analysis
  - **Testing**: Validate against Jan/Feb/Mar 2025 invoices with mixed peak/off-peak rates
  - **Node-RED Migration**: Replace Tibber spot price queries with elprisetjustnu.se + peak logic
