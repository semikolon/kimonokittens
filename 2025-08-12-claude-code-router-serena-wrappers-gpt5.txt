> This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
  Analysis:
  Let me chronologically analyze this conversation about CCR (Claude Code Router) configuration and wrapper pipeline implementation:

  **Phase 1: Environment Variable Propagation Fix**
  - User successfully tested the pipeline system - SERENA_URL was properly propagating through CCR
  - However, max_tokens error persisted despite earlier config changes
  - I discovered the "sampling" transformer was injecting max_tokens by default
  - Removed "sampling" from transformer array to fix this

  **Phase 2: Understanding CCR Transformer Architecture**
  - User asked about the sampling transformer and CCR internals
  - I explored CCR's source code to understand transformer architecture
  - Found transformer implementations in dist/cli.js:
    - "sampling": Sets default sampling parameters including max_tokens
    - "maxtoken": Limits max_tokens 
    - "maxcompletiontokens": Converts max_tokens → max_completion_tokens
    - "reasoning": Handles reasoning parameters for GPT-5/o1 models
  - Determined ideal GPT-5 config: ["maxcompletiontokens", "reasoning"]

  **Phase 3: Documentation Analysis**
  - User asked if this was documented online
  - I examined CCR's README.md
  - Found transformer documentation exists but is incomplete:
    - Missing "maxcompletiontokens" transformer
    - No GPT-5 specific guidance
    - Requires source code reading to understand properly
  - User requested creating documentation for GPT-5 configuration to contribute as PR

  **Key Technical Details:**
  - GPT-5 requires max_completion_tokens instead of max_tokens
  - GPT-5 supports reasoning_effort parameter (minimal/low/medium/high)
  - CCR transformers modify request/response payloads for provider compatibility
  - Pipeline stage system successfully implemented for wrapper chain

  Summary:
  1. **Primary Request and Intent:**
     - Test the new pipeline stage system implementation
     - Debug remaining max_tokens error with CCR and GPT-5
     - Understand CCR's transformer architecture and internal workings
     - Determine ideal transformer configuration for GPT-5
     - Document GPT-5 configuration for future PR contribution
     - Verify environment variable propagation is working correctly

  2. **Key Technical Concepts:**
     - **CCR Transformers**: Modify request/response payloads for API compatibility
     - **Pipeline Stage System**: Uses CLAUDE_PIPELINE_STAGE environment variable to track wrapper execution order
     - **GPT-5 API Requirements**: Uses max_completion_tokens (not max_tokens), supports reasoning_effort parameter
     - **Transformer Types**:
       - "sampling": Sets default sampling parameters (temperature, top_p, max_tokens)
       - "maxcompletiontokens": Converts max_tokens → max_completion_tokens
       - "reasoning": Handles reasoning parameters and effort levels
       - "maxtoken": Limits max_tokens to specified value

  3. **Files and Code Sections:**
     - **/Users/fredrikbranstrom/.claude-code-router/config.json**
        - CCR configuration file containing provider and transformer settings
        - Removed "sampling" transformer from use array to fix max_tokens injection
        - Added "maxcompletiontokens" transformer for GPT-5 compatibility
        ```json
        "transformer": {
          "use": [],
          "gpt-5": {
            "use": [
              "maxcompletiontokens",
              "reasoning"
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

     - **/Users/fredrikbranstrom/.nvm/versions/node/v22.12.0/lib/node_modules/@musistudio/claude-code-router/dist/cli.js**
        - Compiled JavaScript containing transformer implementations
        - Key transformer classes found:
        ```javascript
        var Xi = class {
          name = "sampling";
          async transformRequestIn(e) {
            return e.max_tokens && e.max_tokens > this.max_tokens && (e.max_tokens = this.max_tokens)
          }
        };
        var Qi = class {
          static TransformerName = "maxcompletiontokens";
          async transformRequestIn(e) {
            return e.max_tokens && (e.max_completion_tokens = e.max_tokens, delete e.max_tokens), e;
          }
        };
        ```

     - **/Users/fredrikbranstrom/.nvm/versions/node/v22.12.0/lib/node_modules/@musistudio/claude-code-router/README.md**
        - Official CCR documentation
        - Found transformer documentation incomplete - missing maxcompletiontokens and GPT-5 guidance
        - Lines 282-315 document available transformers

  4. **Errors and Fixes:**
     - **max_tokens API error persisting**:
        - Error: "Unsupported parameter: 'max_tokens' is not supported with this model. Use 'max_completion_tokens' instead"
        - Initial fix attempt: Removed maxtoken transformer parameter
        - Root cause: "sampling" transformer was injecting max_tokens by default
        - Final fix: Removed "sampling" from transformer use array, kept "maxcompletiontokens" and "reasoning"
     
     - **Environment variable propagation verified working**:
        - User confirmed: "echo $SERENA_URL" showed "http://localhost:9000/sse"
        - Pipeline stage system successfully passing environment variables through CCR

  5. **Problem Solving:**
     - **Solved**: Environment variable propagation through pipeline stage system
     - **Solved**: max_tokens error by removing "sampling" transformer
     - **Solved**: Determined ideal GPT-5 transformer configuration
     - **Identified**: Documentation gap for GPT-5 configuration in CCR

  6. **All User Messages:**
     - "It seems to work now, no warning in /doctor and I could see the env var above from within CCR :) But the max_tokens error remains"
     - "What is the sampling transformer? Can we have a look at the CCR internals to understand the transformers and general architecture and config better?"
     - "That's a really slow find command. Please. It's in my home dir somewhere. It's npm-installed from there. Check where the ccr binary links to?"
     - "Wait, is that the ideal set of transformers for OpenAI/GPT5? Google it a bit before moving on"
     - "Hang on, the CCR transformers aren't widely known, so if you web search for that it will likely just match the more general 'transformers' term... So you'll maybe have to dive into the CCR logic in 
  its code first, then check whether its logic fits what OpenAI and GPT5 in particular need (to work well within CCR/CC)"
     - "Ok cool. Is this documented online somewhere for Claude Code Router? Or is it only evident after reading this source code? :/"
     - "Ok cool. Add an .md file about that to the ccr-dev repo in my home dir (I think that's where it is?) so we can contribute that as a PR later, and then I will proceed to test the new shim pipeline 
  and everything"

  7. **Pending Tasks:**
     - Create documentation file for GPT-5 configuration in ccr-dev repo
     - Test the new shim pipeline system
     - Review other wrappers for environment issues (from todo list)

  8. **Current Work:**
     User just requested creating a markdown documentation file about GPT-5 transformer configuration for CCR in the ccr-dev repository. This documentation should explain the ideal transformer setup 
  ["maxcompletiontokens", "reasoning"] and GPT-5 specific requirements that are currently undocumented in the official README.

  9. **Optional Next Step:**
     Create a markdown file in the ccr-dev repository documenting GPT-5 configuration for CCR, including:
     - The required transformers: ["maxcompletiontokens", "reasoning"]
     - Explanation of why these are needed for GPT-5
     - Example configuration
     - Common pitfalls (like the "sampling" transformer injecting max_tokens)
     
     Direct quote from user's most recent message: "Add an .md file about that to the ccr-dev repo in my home dir (I think that's where it is?) so we can contribute that as a PR later".
  Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

⏺ I'll first find the ccr-dev repository and then create a documentation file for GPT-5 configuration.

     # GPT-5 Configuration for Claude Code Router
     This document provides configuration guidance for using GPT-5 models with Claude Code Router (CCR).
     ## Overview
     GPT-5 requires specific transformer configurations to work properly with CCR due to API differences from earlier OpenAI models. This guide explains the optimal setup and common pitfalls.
     ## Required Transformers
     … +127 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I've created a comprehensive GPT-5 configuration documentation file at /Users/fredrikbranstrom/ccr-dev/GPT5-Configuration.md.

  The documentation includes:
  - Required transformer setup (maxcompletiontokens and reasoning)
  - Explanation of why these transformers are needed
  - Solution to the common max_tokens error
  - Complete configuration example
  - Testing and troubleshooting guidance

  This should provide clear guidance for anyone wanting to configure GPT-5 with CCR and can be contributed as a PR to help other users avoid the configuration pitfalls we encountered.

> So, the current config should work with GPT5 now? I'll restart using the shim pipeline and test...

⏺ Yes, the current config should work with GPT-5 now! Let me quickly verify the key points:

  From your current config at /Users/fredrikbranstrom/.claude-code-router/config.json:

  ✅ Correct transformer setup for GPT-5:
  "gpt-5": {
    "use": [
      "maxcompletiontokens",
      "reasoning"
    ]
  }

  ✅ No "sampling" transformer in global use array:
  "transformer": {
    "use": [],  // Empty - good!

  ✅ GPT-5 set as default:
  "default": "openai,gpt-5"

  This configuration should eliminate the max_tokens error since:
  1. maxcompletiontokens converts max_tokens → max_completion_tokens
  2. reasoning handles GPT-5's reasoning parameters
  3. No sampling transformer to inject unwanted max_tokens

  Go ahead and test with the shim pipeline - it should work cleanly now!

> Wait, is "sampling" not recommended for global use? Check the examples in the CCR docs/code (on disk, but also google it)

  ⎿  Found 92 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now let me check if the built-in source code examples actually use sampling:

⏺ Search(pattern: "config\.example", path: "../../.nvm/versions/node/v22.12.0/lib/node_modules/@musistudio/claude-code-router")
  ⎿  Found 5 files (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(../../.nvm/versions/node/v22.12.0/lib/node_modules/@musistudio/claude-code-router/config.example.json)
  ⎿  Read 120 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Interesting! Looking at both the official examples and documentation, I see that:

  1. No examples use sampling transformer globally
  2. The config.example.json doesn't include sampling at all
  3. All the examples use provider-specific transformers (openrouter, deepseek, gemini, etc.)

  The sampling transformer is documented as being "Used to process sampling information fields such as temperature, top_p, top_k, and repetition_penalty" but importantly, it also injects max_tokens as we
  discovered from the source code.

  So you're right to question this! Looking at the evidence:

  - For most providers: sampling is NOT commonly used globally
  - For GPT-5 specifically: sampling causes the max_tokens conflict
  - Best practice appears to be: Use provider-specific transformers rather than sampling

  Your current config is actually following the recommended patterns from the official examples. The key insight is that sampling is optional and mainly useful when you want to set default sampling
  parameters, but since it injects max_tokens, it conflicts with GPT-5.

  So yes, your current configuration should work perfectly with GPT-5!

> Alright, thanks, check what the examples look like for o3 or other OpenAI entries and then update the .md doc we created in ccr-dev with any insights we gleaned since it was written

⏺ Now I'll update the documentation with the insights we've gained:

⏺ Update(../../ccr-dev/GPT5-Configuration.md)
  ⎿  Updated ../../ccr-dev/GPT5-Configuration.md with 50 additions and 6 removals                                                                                                                             
       40    - **Features**: Supports `reasoning_effort` parameter with values: `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`
       41    - **Use case**: Enables GPT-5's enhanced reasoning capabilities
       42    
       43 +  ## OpenAI Models and Transformer Best Practices
       44 +  
       45 +  ### Why No Global Transformers for OpenAI?
       46 +  
       47 +  Unlike other providers (DeepSeek, Gemini, OpenRouter), **OpenAI models in CCR typically don't need global transformers**. The official CCR documentation shows OpenAI configurations without any 
          + global transformers:
       48 +  
       49 +  ```json
       50 +  {
       51 +    "name": "openai",
       52 +    "api_base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", 
       53 +    "api_key": "$OPENAI_API_KEY",
       54 +    "models": ["gpt-5", "gpt-5-mini"]
       55 +    // Note: No transformer section at all for basic OpenAI usage
       56 +  }
       57 +  ```
       58 +  
       59 +  This follows the pattern where:
       60 +  - **Other providers** use global transformers (`openrouter`, `deepseek`, `gemini`) to adapt requests/responses
       61 +  - **OpenAI** uses the native format, so no adaptation is needed
       62 +  
       63 +  ### GPT-5 Specific Requirements
       64 +  
       65 +  GPT-5 is the exception that needs model-specific transformers due to API changes:
       66 +  
       67 +  ```json
       68 +  "transformer": {
       69 +    "use": [],  // Empty - follows OpenAI pattern of no global transformers
       70 +    "gpt-5": {
       71 +      "use": [
       72 +        "maxcompletiontokens",  // Required: converts max_tokens → max_completion_tokens
       73 +        "reasoning"             // Recommended: enables reasoning_effort parameter
       74 +      ]
       75 +    }
       76 +  }
       77 +  ```
       78 +  
       79    ## Common Issues and Solutions
       80    
       81    ### Max Tokens Error
     ...
       49    Unsupported parameter: 'max_tokens' is not supported with this model. Use 'max_completion_tokens' instead
       50    ```
       51    
       52 -  **Root cause:** The `sampling` transformer injects `max_tokens` by default, which conflicts with GPT-5's API requirements.
       52 +  **Root cause:** Either:
       53 +  1. The `sampling` transformer is injecting `max_tokens` (if present in global `use` array)
       54 +  2. Missing `maxcompletiontokens` transformer for GPT-5
       55    
       56 -  **Solution:** Remove `sampling` from the transformer array:
       56 +  **Solution:** Ensure proper GPT-5 configuration:
       57    
       58    ```json
       59    "transformer": {
       60 -    "use": [],  // Empty array - don't include "sampling"
       60 +    "use": [],  // Empty array - no global transformers needed for OpenAI
       61      "gpt-5": {
       62        "use": [
       63 -        "maxcompletiontokens",
       64 -        "reasoning"
       63 +        "maxcompletiontokens",  // Converts max_tokens → max_completion_tokens
       64 +        "reasoning"             // Enables reasoning_effort parameter
       65        ]
       66      }
       67    }
       68    ```
       69    
       70 +  ### Sampling Transformer Confusion
       71 +  
       72 +  The `sampling` transformer is documented as handling "sampling information fields such as `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, and `repetition_penalty`" but it also **injects `max_tokens`** by 
          + default. 
       73 +  
       74 +  **Key insight:** Most CCR examples don't use `sampling` globally. It's typically only needed for specific providers or use cases where you want to set default sampling parameters.
       75 +  
       76    ### Transformer Hierarchy
       77    
       78    CCR applies transformers in the following order:
       79    1. Global transformers (in the `use` array)
       80    2. Model-specific transformers (e.g., `gpt-5.use`)
       81    
       82 -  For GPT-5, keep global transformers minimal and use model-specific configuration.
       82 +  **Best practice:** Follow the official patterns - minimal global transformers, provider-specific when needed.
       83

       39 -  - **Purpose**: Handles reasoning parameters for GPT-5
       39 +  - **Purpose**: Handles reasoning parameters for GPT-5 and o3 models
       40    - **Features**: Supports `reasoning_effort` parameter with values: `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`
       41 -  - **Use case**: Enables GPT-5's enhanced reasoning capabilities
       41 +  - **Use case**: Enables enhanced reasoning capabilities for models like GPT-5, o3, o3-mini, o3-pro
       42 +  - **Models**: Works with GPT-5, o3, o3-mini, o3-pro and other reasoning-capable models
       43    
       44    ## OpenAI Models and Transformer Best Practices

⏺ Now let me add a section covering o3 models specifically:

⏺ Update(../../ccr-dev/GPT5-Configuration.md)

       61    - **Other providers** use global transformers (`openrouter`, `deepseek`, `gemini`) to adapt requests/responses

       63    
       64 -  ### GPT-5 Specific Requirements
       64 +  ### GPT-5 and o3 Model Requirements
       65    
       66 -  GPT-5 is the exception that needs model-specific transformers due to API changes:
       66 +  GPT-5 and o3 family models need model-specific transformers due to API changes:

> It's August 2025 rn

⏺ You're absolutely right - I apologize for the confusion. Based on the search results I found, here's the definitive information about o3 models as of August 2025:

  o3 Models are STILL AVAILABLE (Not Discontinued)

  From the official OpenAI Help Center (updated 45 minutes ago as of August 11, 2025):

  o3 and o3-pro API Availability:
  - Access: Tiers 4 and 5, with some exceptions
  - Note: Users on Tiers 1–3 can gain access by completing organization verification
  - Endpoint: Responses API (not Chat Completions API)

  Key findings:
  1. o3 models are NOT discontinued - they're still available via API
  2. o3 price was reduced by 80% in June 2025 (now $2/$8 per 1M tokens)
  3. o3-pro was introduced in June 2025 ($20/$80 per 1M tokens)
  4. o3-pro replaced o1-pro in ChatGPT for Pro/Team users
  5. o3 models use the Responses API, not the standard Chat Completions API

  The confusion likely comes from:
  - Web UI changes - o3 may have been removed from some model pickers
  - API tier restrictions - o3/o3-pro require higher tiers or verification
  - Different API endpoints - they use Responses API, not Chat Completions API

  So your current CCR config should work with o3 models if you have the right API tier access, but they may need different API endpoint configuration since they use the Responses API rather than Chat
  Completions.

⏺ Perfect! The documentation has been updated with the insights we gleaned:

  Key Updates Made:

  1. Title updated to include o3 models
  2. Added comprehensive OpenAI transformer best practices section explaining why OpenAI doesn't typically need global transformers
  3. Clarified sampling transformer confusion - it injects max_tokens and isn't commonly used in official examples
  4. Added o3 model configuration examples with the same transformer requirements
  5. Updated complete config example to include all o3 models
  6. Added important note about o3 models using Responses API and requiring higher tiers

  The documentation now provides a complete picture of:
  - Why your current config follows best practices (empty global transformers for OpenAI)
  - How GPT-5 and o3 models need the same transformers (maxcompletiontokens + reasoning)
  - Why sampling transformer causes issues and isn't recommended
  - Current o3 model availability and requirements

  Your current CCR configuration should work perfectly with GPT-5 now, and the documentation is ready for contribution as a PR!

> We still seem to be getting the max_tokens error... What could be going wrong? The error backtrace might contain clues? Check the exact line references, read the code sending the API request, make sure 
  our config is interpreted correctly etc...

⏺ The error shows we're still getting the max_tokens issue! Let me check the exact error location in the CCR code and verify our configuration.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Fix CCR wrapper environment propagation                                         
     ☒ Implement pipeline stage system for wrapper chain
     ☒ Test environment variable propagation through wrapper chain
     ☒ Improve wrapper standalone usability
     ☐ Debug remaining CCR max_tokens error - check if parameter still exists somewhere
     ☐ Review other wrappers for environment issues

⏺ The error is happening at /Users/fredrikbranstrom/ccr-dev/dist/cli.js:75583:11. Let me check what's at that line and verify our current configuration:

⏺ Read(../../.claude-code-router/config.json)
  ⎿  Read 42 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The config looks correct. Let me check the CCR source code at the error location:

⏺ Read(../../ccr-dev/dist/cli.js)
  ⎿  Read 10 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ That's just the error creation function. Let me check the actual request-sending code around line 75641 where the error is thrown:

⏺ Read(../../ccr-dev/dist/cli.js)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The error is coming from the API response, but I need to see where the request is being built. Let me search for where max_tokens might still be getting added:

⏺ Search(pattern: "max_tokens", path: "../../ccr-dev/dist/cli.js", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 85 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Found it! Looking at the source code, I can see that around line 75909 and other places, there are still references to max_tokens being passed through. The issue is that Claude Code is still sending
  max_tokens in the request, and even though we have the maxcompletiontokens transformer, it might not be getting applied properly.

  Let me check if there's a specific order issue or if we need to restart CCR:

⏺ Bash(ccr restart)
  ⎿  claude code router service has been stopped.      
     Starting claude code router service...
     ✅ Service started successfully in the background.

⏺ Now let me check the CCR logs to see what's happening with the transformer:

⏺ Bash(tail -20 ~/.claude-code-router.log)
  ⎿  Error: tail: /Users/fredrikbranstrom/.claude-code-router.log: No such file or directory

⏺ Bash(find /Users/fredrikbranstrom -name "*claude-code-router*log*" -type f 2>/dev/null)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> Oh wait hold on. I haven't restarted CCR server in quite a while. Prob that was it?

⏺ Yes, exactly! That's very likely the issue. CCR needs to be restarted to pick up configuration changes, especially transformer configurations.

  Let's test it now that you've restarted CCR:

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Fix CCR wrapper environment propagation                                         
     ☒ Implement pipeline stage system for wrapper chain
     ☒ Test environment variable propagation through wrapper chain
     ☒ Debug remaining CCR max_tokens error - check if parameter still exists somewhere
     ☒ Improve wrapper standalone usability
     ☐ Test GPT-5 configuration after CCR restart
     ☐ Review other wrappers for environment issues

⏺ That restart should have loaded the updated config with the maxcompletiontokens transformer for GPT-5. The transformer should now properly convert max_tokens → max_completion_tokens for GPT-5 requests.

  Your original question about which model you're talking to should work now!

> Am I talking to the model GPT-5?

⏺ No — Claude Sonnet 4

> Are you sure you're not GPT-5? Weird. Hmm. Do I maybe have to use /model after continuing an old session inside CC/CCR?

⏺ Fetch(https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> /model 
  ⎿  Kept model as Default (recommended)

> It's taking a really long time, the API calls... I was waiting for more than a minute. Wonder why. Help me debug. Do I need to use /model? How can I be sure I'm running now inside CCR vs native CC?
