What are some alternatives to Dakboard? I can do some coding and design on my own no problem. Maybe there are some frameworks geared to creating and maintaining dashboards like this though. What do you already know about my IT setup in the house and my aims for the dashboard and LLM integration and so on?

Thought about dashboard alternatives and frameworks for 11 seconds
From what you’ve mentioned before, I know you’re running a Raspberry Pi in your house with Ruby (Agoo), NodeRED, Mosquitto, and currently using Dakboard. You also host kimonokittens.com on that Pi, doing port-forwarding and data routing through NodeRED. You want a custom dashboard that can integrate local data and possibly use LLM features for interactive insights or automation.

You said:
Yes! So, what are some alternatives to Dakboard, which I used to run, and for which the Agoo server is adapted currently

MagicMirror: Primarily for “smart mirror” setups, but it’s actually just a Node.js app with modules for calendar, weather, and more. Highly extensible if you’re comfortable with JavaScript.

Node-RED Dashboard: Since you’re already using Node-RED, you could leverage its built-in dashboard nodes to create a real-time UI. It’s quick for IoT integrations but offers less fine-grained styling out of the box.

Home Assistant / Lovelace UI: If you lean toward home automation, this gives a robust dashboard engine with custom cards, though it’s more about smart-home devices.

Grafana: Great for charting time-series data (like sensor readings). It can be themed and embedded, though it’s more data-visualization focused than a “family calendar + info” type dashboard.

Custom Web App: Using any front-end framework (React, Vue, Svelte) or a Ruby-based setup. You can mix your own HTML/CSS with calls to Node-RED, Mosquitto, or an LLM endpoint for maximum flexibility.

You said:
Lovelace UI? Tell me more. And about MagicMirror and its pros and cons.

I guess I could have a custom web app, would be cool, not beyond me at all, just a bit of an initial investment of energy, but...

Thought about Lovelace UI and MagicMirror for 5 seconds
Lovelace UI (Home Assistant)

What it is: Home Assistant’s built-in dashboard interface.

Pros: Seamless smart-home integration (sensors, switches, automations, etc.), wide community of custom cards/plugins, easy to configure in either YAML or through a UI.

Cons: Requires running Home Assistant; not as straightforward for purely custom data or layouts unless you’re comfortable editing configs and working within HA’s structure.

MagicMirror

What it is: A Node.js “smart mirror” dashboard that displays modules for weather, calendar, news feeds, etc.

Pros: Simple to install; large community with ready-made modules; easy to add or remove features in a config file.

Cons: Limited styling out of the box (primarily designed for mirror displays); deeper customization requires delving into JS/HTML. Not as flexible for unique data sources unless you create custom modules.

You said:
How hard is it to customize MagicMirror? It seems to have an abundance of custom modules on GitHub...
ChatGPT said:
Thought about MagicMirror customization for a couple of seconds
MagicMirror is fairly straightforward to customize for basic needs—most users just edit a central config file (config.js) to add or remove community modules. There are indeed a ton of community modules on GitHub covering everything from advanced weather widgets to smart-home integrations.

If you just want to display existing data types (calendar, RSS, weather, etc.), it’s typically a matter of copying a module folder, configuring parameters in config.js, and styling with some custom CSS if needed. Deep customization or pulling in unique data sources might require writing a custom module in JavaScript, but there’s a lot of reference material and examples to follow.

You said:
If I want as much customizability and also flexibility to write custom code as possible (I'm gonna be AI-coding more and more of this from now on, so not afraid of complexity as long as it serves my aims) and I have a local Agoo server with a few JSON endpoints I want our custom CSS dashboard with fancy animations etc with dependably high FPS - GPU on my Dell Optiplex Linux box hardware-accelerated for sure - then what's a good starting point / strategy / should I even use a framework?

TL;DR
For maximum freedom + 60 fps visuals, build a small-runtime, compile-time front-end (Svelte 5 / SvelteKit or SolidJS 2 / SolidStart) and point it at your Agoo JSON/WebSocket endpoints. You keep full control of markup, CSS, WebGL/Canvas, and animation libraries, with almost zero framework overhead.

Why a “compile-time” framework?
Criterion	React/Angular	Svelte 5 / SolidJS 2
Runtime weight	40–100 kB+	≈ 1–5 kB bundle overhead
Re-render cost	Virtual-DOM diff	Fine-grained signals → native DOM writes
Animation smoothness	extra batching layer	direct, ~bare-metal updates
Learning curve	familiar, verbose	terse, component + store model
State of 2025	React 19 adds RSC, but still heavy	Both are stable & gaining share 
merge.rocks
medium.com
Svelte 5’s compiler strips itself out at build time and shipped its big rewrite in Oct 2024 
svelte.dev
.
Solid 2.0 (under active RC) keeps a tiny runtime while adding concurrent transitions & auto-batching 
github.com
.

Both comfortably hit 60 fps on a Dell Optiplex’s iGPU, especially if you:

keep animation work in transform/opacity CSS properties or WebGL,

avoid layout thrash (translate/scale vs top/left),

buffer frequent updates through requestAnimationFrame,

lazy-load heavy widgets (charts, 3D scenes).

Suggested architecture
Agoo (Ruby) ── /api/* JSON + /ws
                  │
          ┌───────┴────────┐
          │ Front-end build │  (Vite)
          └────────┬───────┘
     Dev on Optiplex │  Static bundle → Pi
Backend (unchanged)

Keep Agoo serving /api/* JSON and optionally /ws WebSockets or SSE for push.

MQTT from Mosquitto remains your real-time bus; bridge to WebSocket if needed.

Front-end stack

pnpm dlx create-svelte@latest dashboard or pnpm dlx create-solid@latest.

Add Tailwind (utility CSS) and Framer-Motion / MotionOne for declarative animations.

Compose any WebGL/Canvas bits with Three.js or PixiJS as child components.

DX extras

Turn on Vite auto-HMR for live edits.

Use vite-plugin-pwa if you want an offline kiosk mode.

Bundle deploy: vite build && rsync dist/ pi:/var/www/dashboard.

Rendering the dashboard

Launch Chromium in kiosk (chromium --kiosk --enable-gpu-rasterization ...) at Pi boot; hardware acceleration is on by default in current Raspberry Pi OS images.

Starting template (Svelte 5)
Below is a minimal snippet that hits your /api/house_state every 2 s and animates a card when the JSON changes—no virtual DOM involved:

<script>
  import { tweened } from 'svelte/motion';
  import { cubicOut } from 'svelte/easing';
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';

  let house = {};
  const opacity = tweened(0, { duration: 400, easing: cubicOut });

  async function refresh() {
    const res = await fetch('/api/house_state');
    house = await res.json();
    opacity.set(1).then(() => opacity.set(0));
  }

  onMount(() => {
    refresh();
    const t = setInterval(refresh, 2000);
    return () => clearInterval(t);
  });
</script>

<div class="rounded-xl shadow-xl p-6 bg-slate-900 text-white"
     style="opacity:{ $opacity }">
  <h1 class="text-2xl mb-2">Room temps</h1>
  {#each Object.entries(house.temps) as [room, t]}
    <p class="font-mono">{room}: {t} °C</p>
  {/each}
</div>
Compile size: ≈ 3 kB JS + your CSS.

When you might skip a framework
If you only need a single full-screen Canvas/WebGL scene and can hand-craft DOM overlays, vanilla TS + Lit or plain custom elements suffices. But for multiple interactive widgets, theming, routing, and evolving requirements, Svelte/Solid gives you:

component organisation,

built-in reactivity,

ecosystem (charts, calendars, map libs).

The minimal runtime tax is worth the huge productivity gain.

Next step?
Let me know if you’d like:

a full repo scaffold with Vite + Svelte 5,

or a SolidStart variant,

or tips on wiring MQTT → WebSocket.

Happy to generate the skeleton or walk through any specific integration details.
