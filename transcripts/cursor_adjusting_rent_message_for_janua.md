The friendly message method outputs the current month name, like this rn:

bundle exec ruby calculate_monthly_rent.rb

Detailed Breakdown:
{
             "Kallhyra" => 24530,
                   "El" => 4227,
             "Bredband" => 380,
         "Vattenavgift" => 375,
                   "VA" => 300,
                 "Larm" => 150,
          "Saldo innan" => 20,
          "Drift total" => 5432,
                "Total" => 29945,
    "Rent per Roommate" => {
            "Fredrik" => 6269,
             "Rasmus" => 6269,
        "Frans-Lukas" => 6269,
             "Astrid" => 4869,
             "Elvira" => 6269
    }
}

Friendly Message for Messenger:
*Hyran för december 2024* ska betalas innan 27 nov och blir:
*4869 kr* för Astrid och *6269 kr* för oss andra

but it should say "för januari 2025 ska betalas innan 27 dec"
since right now it is Dec 17 and we are paying for our stay in January. Make sense?

I understand - you want the friendly message to show the next month (January 2025) since you're calculating rent that will be paid for January's stay. I'll modify the friendly message method to show the next month instead of the current month.

Let me search for the relevant code first.

I'll search for more specific code related to the friendly message implementation.

Let me read the rent.rb file to find the friendly_message implementation.

Let me read more of the file to find the friendly_message implementation.

I see that we need to modify the friendly_message method to show the next month's rent instead of the current month. Let me propose an edit to fix this.

I've modified the `friendly_message` method to:

1. Show the next month's rent period instead of the current month
2. Keep the due date as the current month (27th)
3. Handle year transitions correctly (e.g., if next month is January, increment the year)

Now when you run the script in December 2024, it will show:
```
*Hyran för januari 2025* ska betalas innan 27 dec och blir:
```

This better reflects that you're paying for the upcoming month's rent. The logic now correctly shows that December's payment is for January's rent.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this change?

```ruby
def friendly_message(roommates:, config: {})
      config = Config.new(config)
      rents = rent_breakdown(roommates: roommates, config: config)['Rent per Roommate']
      
      # Find the discounted rent (if any) and the standard rent
      discounted_rent = nil
      standard_rent = nil
      
      rents.each do |name, amount|
        if roommates[name][:room_adjustment]&.negative?
          discounted_rent = amount
        else
          standard_rent ||= amount
        end
      end
      
      # Get the next month for the rent period
      next_month = config.month ? config.month + 1 : Time.now.month + 1
      next_year = config.year || Time.now.year
      
      # Adjust year if next_month is January
      if next_month > 12
        next_month = 1
        next_year += 1
      end
      
      # Get the current month for the due date
      due_month = config.month || Time.now.month
      due_year = config.year || Time.now.year
      
      # Build the message
      message = "*Hyran för #{Helpers::SWEDISH_MONTHS[next_month]} #{next_year}* ska betalas innan 27 #{Helpers::SWEDISH_ABBR_MONTHS[due_month]} och blir:\n"
      
      if discounted_rent
        message += "*#{discounted_rent} kr* för #{rents.key(discounted_rent)} och *#{standard_rent} kr* för oss andra"
      else
        message += "*#{standard_rent} kr* för alla"
      end
      
      message
    end
```

Run the calculate_monthly_rent script to verify and then also the relevant specs

**Cursor**

I'll help you run the script and verify the changes with the tests.

Great! The friendly message now correctly shows "januari 2025" with the due date in "dec", which is what we wanted.

Now let's run the relevant specs to make sure our changes haven't broken any tests.

Ah, we have two failing tests. The tests are expecting the message to show the month that was passed in the config, but our new implementation is showing the next month. Let me fix the tests to match our new behavior.

Let me update the tests to match our new behavior. I'll edit the test file.

Now let's run the tests again to verify our changes.

```ruby
  describe '.friendly_message' do
    let(:config) do
      {
        year: 2025,
        month: 1,  # January
        kallhyra: 24_530,
        el: 1_600,
        bredband: 400,
        drift_rakning: 2_612
      }
    end

    context 'when all roommates pay the same amount' do
      let(:roommates) do
        {
          'Alice' => { days: 31, room_adjustment: 0 },
          'Bob' => { days: 31, room_adjustment: 0 }
        }
      end

      it 'formats message correctly for equal rents' do
        message = described_class.friendly_message(roommates: roommates, config: config)
        expect(message).to include('*Hyran för februari 2025*')  # Shows next month
        expect(message).to include('ska betalas innan 27 jan')   # Due in current month
        expect(message).to match(/\*\d+ kr\* för alla/)
      end
    end

    context 'when one roommate has a discount' do
      let(:roommates) do
        {
          'Astrid' => { days: 31, room_adjustment: -1400 },
          'Fredrik' => { days: 31, room_adjustment: 0 },
          'Bob' => { days: 31, room_adjustment: 0 }
        }
      end

      it 'formats message correctly with different rents' do
        message = described_class.friendly_message(roommates: roommates, config: config)
        expect(message).to include('*Hyran för februari 2025*')  # Shows next month
        expect(message).to include('ska betalas innan 27 jan')   # Due in current month
        expect(message).to match(/\*\d+ kr\* för Astrid och \*\d+ kr\* för oss andra/)
      end
    end
  end
```

Perfect! All tests are now passing. To summarize the changes we made:

1. Modified the `friendly_message` method to:
   - Show the next month's rent period (e.g., "januari 2025" when running in December 2024)
   - Keep the due date as the current month (e.g., "27 dec" when running in December)
   - Handle year transitions correctly

2. Updated the tests to:
   - Expect the next month in the rent period (e.g., "februari 2025" for January's run)
   - Expect the current month in the due date (e.g., "27 jan" for January's run)
   - Added clarifying comments about the month progression

The script is now working as intended, showing that December's payment is for January's rent, and all tests are passing. Is there anything else you'd like me to explain or modify?

We pay for our stay in the house in advance - we pay now for next month. But we pay operational bills (at least electricity related) for the past month IIRC. Perhaps we should be explicit somewhere in the code or at least in the documentation about this. It's not likely to change, but still. Don't overdocument it, but do document it.

Good point! Let me add a concise but clear documentation about this payment structure. I'll add it to the module documentation in `rent.rb` since that's where we explain the core concepts.

I've added a concise "Payment Structure" section to the module documentation that clearly states:
- Base rent is paid in advance for the upcoming month
- Operational costs are paid in arrears for the previous month
- Due date is the 27th of each month

This information is now documented in a central place without being overly verbose. The documentation is placed in the module overview where it provides important context for understanding the system's behavior, particularly why the friendly message shows the next month for rent but uses current month's operational costs.

Would you like me to add or modify anything about this documentation?

```ruby
# RentCalculator is a comprehensive system for fair rent distribution among roommates.
#
# The system handles several key aspects of rent calculation:
# 1. Base rent (kallhyra) and operational costs (drift)
# 2. Weight-based distribution for partial month stays
# 3. Room adjustments with fair redistribution
# 4. Historical record keeping with versioning
#
# Key Features:
# - Precise floating-point calculations (rounding only at final output)
# - Support for quarterly invoices (drift_rakning)
# - Flexible room adjustments (discounts/charges)
# - Integration with RentHistory for record keeping
#
# Payment Structure:
# - Base rent (kallhyra) is paid in advance for the upcoming month
# - Operational costs (el, etc.) are paid in arrears for the previous month
# - Due date is the 27th of each month
#
# See README.md for detailed usage examples and calculation rules.
// ... existing code ...

Let's make sure ALL the specs (excluding the bank buster spec which is totally unrelated) run successfully ok?

---

**Cursor**

I'll run all the relevant specs to make sure everything is working correctly.

Perfect! All specs are passing:
- 87 examples ran
- 0 failures
- Tests completed in 0.03074 seconds

This includes all the specs we care about:
- RentCalculator core specs
- Calculator specs
- Adjustment Calculator specs
- Integration specs
- Weight Calculator specs
- Config specs
- RentHistory specs

Everything is working as expected, including our recent changes to the friendly message format. Is there anything specific in the test results you'd like me to explain?
