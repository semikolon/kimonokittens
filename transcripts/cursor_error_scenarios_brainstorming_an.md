Can you brainstorm likely error scenarios, and then sort through them based on degree of risk, and let's reflect together

**Cursor**

Sure, let's brainstorm likely error scenarios for your project and sort them based on the degree of risk. This will help prioritize documentation and mitigation strategies.

### **High-Risk Error Scenarios**

1. **Data Loss Due to Database Corruption**
   - **Description:** The SQLite database becomes corrupted, leading to loss of critical data such as roommate information, payment history, and configurations.
   - **Impact:** Severe disruption of service, potential loss of historical data, and inability to perform rent calculations accurately.
   - **Mitigation Strategies:**
     - Implement regular database backups.
     - Add backup and restore functionalities.
     - Use transactions to ensure database integrity.
     - Monitor database health and set up alerts for anomalies.

2. **Incorrect Rent Calculations**
   - **Description:** Bugs in the rent calculation logic result in inaccurate charges, either overcharging or undercharging roommates.
   - **Impact:** Financial discrepancies, eroded trust among roommates, potential legal issues.
   - **Mitigation Strategies:**
     - Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for calculation functions.
     - Perform manual testing with real data before deployment.
     - Implement data validation for inputs (e.g., move-in/out dates, room adjustments).
     - Code reviews to catch logical errors.

3. **Security Vulnerabilities in API Exposure**
   - **Description:** Unauthorized access to the rent calculator API allows malicious actors to retrieve or manipulate sensitive data.
   - **Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations, potential legal ramifications.
   - **Mitigation Strategies:**
     - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
     - Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
     - Sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
     - Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

4. **Failure in SMS Reminders and Swish Integration**
   - **Description:** Automated SMS reminders fail to send due to API issues or misconfigurations, and payment links are incorrect.
   - **Impact:** Delayed or missed payments, confusion among roommates, decreased reliability of the system.
   - **Mitigation Strategies:**
     - Add error handling and retries for SMS sending.
     - Validate generated Swish payment links.
     - Set up monitoring for API integrations.
     - Provide fallback communication methods (e.g., email notifications).

### **Medium-Risk Error Scenarios**

1. **Invalid Roommate Data Entry**
   - **Description:** Users input invalid data such as negative days, incorrect dates, or overlapping move-in/out periods.
   - **Impact:** Errors in calculations, potential application crashes, inconsistent data.
   - **Mitigation Strategies:**
     - Implement robust data validation and input sanitization.
     - Provide clear error messages and guidance for correct data entry.
     - Use form controls with predefined options where applicable.

2. **File Access and Permission Issues**
   - **Description:** The application lacks the necessary permissions to read or write files, leading to failures in data storage or retrieval.
   - **Impact:** Inability to save configurations or access data, which can halt application functionality.
   - **Mitigation Strategies:**
     - Check and handle file permissions during setup.
     - Use exception handling to provide informative messages.
     - Document required permissions in the installation guide.

3. **Version Conflicts and Migration Failures**
   - **Description:** Database schema changes without proper migration lead to version conflicts and potential data loss.
   - **Impact:** Application crashes, data inconsistency, or corruption.
   - **Mitigation Strategies:**
     - Implement a robust migration system for schema changes.
     - Use version control for database versions.
     - Test migrations thoroughly before deployment.

4. **Automation Failures in Bill Retrieval**
   - **Description:** Changes in utility supplier websites cause the scraping scripts to fail, leading to outdated or missing cost data.
   - **Impact:** Inaccurate rent calculations due to missing expense data.
   - **Mitigation Strategies:**
     - Monitor supplier websites for changes.
     - Build resilience into scraping scripts with adaptive parsing.
     - Establish manual entry procedures as a fallback.

### **Low-Risk Error Scenarios**

1. **Formatting Issues in Output Messages**
   - **Description:** Messenger-friendly formatting does not render correctly, affecting readability (e.g., bold text, Swedish month names).
   - **Impact:** Reduced clarity in communications, but core functionality remains unaffected.
   - **Mitigation Strategies:**
     - Test output formats across different messaging platforms.
     - Use localization libraries for consistent month names.
     - Provide options for users to select preferred formats.

2. **Performance Degradation Over Time**
   - **Description:** As the database grows, queries become slower, leading to performance issues.
   - **Impact:** Slower response times may affect user experience.
   - **Mitigation Strategies:**
     - Implement indexing on database tables.
     - Archive old data that is no longer needed.
     - Monitor performance and perform regular maintenance.

3. **Inadequate Handling of One-time Fees and Deposits**
   - **Description:** Special cases like security deposits or shared purchases are not calculated correctly.
   - **Impact:** Minor financial discrepancies, user dissatisfaction.
   - **Mitigation Strategies:**
     - Clearly define rules for one-time fees and deposits.
     - Enhance the calculation logic to accommodate special cases.
     - Document guidelines for fair distribution.

### **Reflection**

By categorizing these error scenarios, we can prioritize efforts to address the most critical risks:

- **High-risk errors** have severe impacts and need immediate attention, especially those affecting data integrity and security.
- **Medium-risk errors** can disrupt functionality but are less likely to cause catastrophic failures. They should be addressed after high-risk issues.
- **Low-risk errors** mostly affect user experience and can be scheduled accordingly.

**Next Steps:**

- **Documentation:** Start with documenting high-risk error scenarios, providing clear resolution steps, prevention guidelines, and recovery procedures.
- **Testing:** Enhance testing strategies focusing on areas with high-risk potential.
- **Mitigation Planning:** Develop and implement mitigation strategies for each scenario.
