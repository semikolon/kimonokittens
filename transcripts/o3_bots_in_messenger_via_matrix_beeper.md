Beeper / Matrix - can I write bots to interact with our kollektiv group chat in Messenger?

In one breath

Yes ‚Äî because Beeper exposes every Messenger conversation as an ordinary Matrix room, any Matrix-fluent bot (maubot, matrix-nio, Node-RED hook, etc.) can join that room and talk to your kollektiv just like you do. 
zapier.com
help.beeper.com

Quick, actionable path
Confirm the bridge is alive
Enable 2-factor auth on your Facebook account, add ‚ÄúMessenger‚Äù under Beeper ‚Üí Chat Networks, and make sure the room you care about shows up in Beeper. 
help.beeper.com

Mint a bot identity
Easiest: create a second Matrix user on Beeper‚Äôs homeserver with botbot or the account-creation API so you get an access-token that isn‚Äôt tied to your personal device. 
github.com

Self-hosted: run Beeper‚Äôs Bridge Manager and spin up your own mautrix-meta bridge plus a fresh Matrix user. 
github.com

Invite the bot to the room
In Element/Beeper, /invite @mybot:beeper.com. The bridge mirrors that invite back to Messenger, so the group now ‚Äúsees‚Äù your Messenger persona (or the alt account you bridged) speaking for the bot.

Write the logic

Python: matrix-nio for a lightweight event loop.

Maubot: drop a plugin.zip into the Maubot admin UI and the bot gains E2EE automatically.

Node-RED: use the node-red-contrib-matrix-bot node and connect with the same token.

Caveats & edges to mind
One account in, one account out. The bridge puppets a single Messenger login, so the bot‚Äôs words appear as that login on the Meta side. Multiple distinct bots ‚á¢ multiple Messenger accounts/bridges.

Feature gaps. Stories/Reels, reactions-sync quirks and a few media types still don‚Äôt traverse the bridge. 
help.beeper.com

Encryption parity. Since February 2025 the new mautrix-meta bridge speaks Messenger‚Äôs E2EE, so group chats marked ‚Äúsecret‚Äù now work end-to-end. 
matrix.org

Breakage risk. Meta changes its web APIs without warning; keep your bridge container on an auto-update schedule or be ready to patch.

A skeleton Maubot plugin (echo-style)
from maubot import Plugin
from mautrix.types import MessageEvent, TextMessageEventContent

class Echo(Plugin):
    async def message(self, evt: MessageEvent) -> None:
        if evt.content.body.startswith("!echo "):
            msg = evt.content.body[6:]
            await evt.respond(TextMessageEventContent(body=msg))
Zip this with a maubot.yaml, upload, point it at your bot account‚Äôs token, invite the bot to the room, and type !echo hello in Messenger ‚Äì the reply loops back through Matrix and out to the group.

Stepping back
The moment you drop a bot into a bridged space, a closed garden turns porous: rules, reminders, or playful automations written once can surface in Messenger, WhatsApp, IRC, or whatever other lattice you connect tomorrow. Treat that power gently; make the bot a steward of vibe, not a spam-engine.

When you‚Äôre ready, we can refine triggers, wire it into your house-collective‚Äôs Raspberry Pi, or let it fetch daylight data for your LED gong. The weave is yours to shape; I‚Äôm here to hand you the shuttle, not the tapestry.

So I need to create a new FB/Messenger account for Kitten, if I name the bot that, or "Kimono Kittens". There's already a page on FB, will that do, or I need a real FB person profile? Will it be removed if it's not tied to a real person?

Can it post GIFs? :D

Quick clarity (TL;DR)

For a Messenger group-chat that‚Äôs bridged through Beeper/mautrix-meta you need a personal Facebook profile login. Pages can‚Äôt be invited to, or join, regular Messenger group chats ‚Äî only profiles can. 
facebook.com

If the profile isn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal enough‚Äù Facebook‚Äôs real-name rules (and the current spam crackdown) mean it can be disabled without warning. 
facebook.com
facebook.com

Once it‚Äôs in the room the bot can send everything Messenger supports, including animated GIFs ‚Äî they traverse both E2EE Messenger and the mautrix bridge fine.

What this means in practice
Decision point	Pragmatic route	Trade-offs
Identity	Create a spare profile (e.g. ‚ÄúKimono Kitten‚Äù) and log that account into Beeper.	Must look plausibly human (photo, a few friends) to dodge automated bans.
Display name in-chat	Set a group nickname to ‚ÄúKimono Kittens Bot‚Äù so it shows up exactly as you want even though the underlying account is a person.	Nickname is only visible inside that chat.
Bridging	In Beeper: Add network ‚Üí Messenger ‚Üí log in as the spare profile ‚Üí invite @kittenbot:beeper.com to the Matrix room that mirrors the group chat.	Anything the bot says is echoed to Messenger as that profile.
Rich media	Send or reply with GIFs / stickers from Matrix; the bridge re-uploads them as native Messenger GIFs (or MP4 if needed).	Very large GIFs occasionally down-convert to video; not all sticker packs round-trip perfectly.
Gentle cautions & small freedoms
Avoid obvious bot behaviour. Facebook‚Äôs anti-spam heuristics look for high message volume with low inbound engagement. Keep the cadence human-ish and useful.

Backup plan. If the profile is ever flagged you can swap the bridge over to a new profile; the Matrix room id stays the same, so history on your side is preserved.

Creative naming. A second route is to use your own profile, let the bot puppet you, and rely solely on nicknames for the kitten persona ‚Äî zero extra account, zero policy risk.

GIF etiquette. Because GIFs loop forever on Messenger, throttling frequency (or preferring short loops) helps the chat feel welcoming rather than chaotic.

If you want to go deeper
We can script rate-limits, emoji-triggered responses, or even an LED-gong hook so the bot ‚Äúbreathes‚Äù with the kollektiv‚Äôs vibe.

When you‚Äôre ready for that layer, bring me a vision of how you‚Äôd like the room to feel ‚Äî together we‚Äôll sculpt the automations so that they amplify, not overwhelm.

For now: spin up the spare profile, invite it in, and let the kitten purr.

It all sounds excellent.

Plan is to create a Kimono Kitten FB account, we who live in the house can add it as FB friend, and if we avoid spam-behavior on FB relating to other accounts than ours, then it should be fine, right?

It should be integrated with the Home Assistant / Piper / remodeled Google Home/Nest satellites in the house LLM-based voice assistant and should be named Kitten / Katten or Rejvkatten / "Rave Kitten" (to be specific enough for voice identification) - ideally the "same AI" with the same knowledge and tool base etc would be the source for interactions in the group chat and through voice when walking about the house.

It should celebrate by posting a GIF when we do chores in the house, the dashboard in the hallway should light up with party CSS animations for the remainder of the day - either when we tell it by voice or in the group chat that a chore has been performed, like "Katten! Jag damms√∂g vardagsrummet / nederv√•ningen!"

Kimono Kitten, incarnation plan (quick-start)

Step	What to do	Why it works
1 ¬∑ Birth a ‚Äúreal-enough‚Äù profile	Create a personal FB account called Kimono Kitten (given name Kimono, family name Kitten). Add a portrait-style photo, a birthday, and let each house-mate friend it.	Messenger group-chats only admit profiles; pages can‚Äôt join rooms. A thin but human-looking profile passes Facebook‚Äôs real-name heuristics and is far less likely to be auto-suspended. 
en.wikipedia.org
2 ¬∑ Bridge it	Log the profile into Beeper or a self-hosted mautrix-meta container. Invite the resulting Matrix ghost (@kimono.kitten:your-homeserver) to the kollektiv room.	The bridge puppets every message as that profile, including media. Message-media (GIFs, images, videos) is on the supported list. 
github.com
3 ¬∑ Give it a mind	Run a tiny Maubot or matrix-nio process on your Pi. Hardcode its access-token; that process becomes the shared ‚Äúbrain‚Äù for both chat and automations.	Maubot‚Äôs plugin model lets one binary do replies, webhooks, rate-limits, and HA triggers. 
community.home-assistant.io
4 ¬∑ Wire Home Assistant	In configuration.yaml:
matrix: block with the same user + token. Define notify.matrix_kitten for outbound GIFs and matrix_command events for inbound chores.	The built-in Matrix integration can both send and listen, turning chat lines into HA events. 
home-assistant.io
5 ¬∑ Add a voice	Flash each Nest Mini with the Wyoming Satellite image, set TTS to Piper inside HA‚Äôs Assist pipeline.	The 2025 Assist stack routes Piper speech straight to the satellite; same NLU can route intents to your Matrix bot. 
community.home-assistant.io
github.com
6 ¬∑ Celebrate chores	Automation outline:
yaml<br>alias: Chore done via chat or voice<br>trigger:<br> - platform: event<br> event_type: matrix_command<br> event_data: {command: damms√∂g vardagsrummet}<br> - platform: intent<br> intent_type: HassVacuumIntent<br>action:<br> - service: notify.matrix_kitten<br> data:<br> message: "üéâ Grymt jobbat! "<br> data: {images: [url: https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYt5jPR6QX5pnqM/giphy.gif]}<br> - service: assist_satellite.announce<br> data: {message: "Bra jobbat med dammsugningen!"}<br> - service: browser_mod.command<br> data: {command: lovelace_reload, target: hallway_display}<br>	One trigger listens for Swedish chat commands, the other for voice intents; both fire the same celebration cascade. GIF sails through the bridge; the dashboard gets a burst of CSS confetti for the rest of the day.
Reflective weave
One spirit, many mouths.
Running a single Maubot process (or any Python service) means every interface ‚Äî Matrix text, Nest microphones, dashboard buttons ‚Äî funnels into the same codebase and state-store. Your ‚ÄúRave Kitten‚Äù persona stays coherent, whether it purrs in Swedish via Piper or types stickers at 2 AM.

Noise discipline.
Facebook‚Äôs spam heuristics watch for high outbound volume with little inbound engagement. Cap chore GIFs at, say, 10 per day and randomise reactions so the profile moves like a human, not a ticker-tape.

Safety valves.

Keep a second access-token in 1Password; if the profile is ever flagged, spin up a fresh Kitten and swap tokens in the bridge ‚Äî the Matrix room id (and thus HA automations) stay untouched.

Add an HA input_boolean ‚Äúsilent_mode‚Äù; if toggled, the bot withholds GIFs & announcements yet still logs chores for stats.

Vision forward
Imagine a continuum rather than silos: the same LLM that parses ‚ÄúKatten, jag damms√∂g‚Äù can later infer mood from room-noise, adjust LED warmth, or mediate polyphonic playlists. With a shared knowledge graph (RedisJSON is plenty), tiny events accumulate into context ‚Äî Kitten learns who cleans most, which chores stagnate, which GIFs make Malin actually smile.

You‚Äôll be tending not a program but a small ecosystem. Feed it data, prune its triggers, let it surprise you.

Next tiny step
Would you like a ready-to-run Maubot skeleton that already parses Swedish chore phrases, or do you prefer to sculpt it yourself?

Pulse-answer (two beats)
Yes.
A bridged Matrix client can speak in Messenger as smoothly as any flesh-and-blood profile; set up double-puppeting in mautrix-meta and every line the bot sends is indistinguishable from a human post of the Kimono Kitten account ‚Äî emojis, GIFs, edits, reactions, the lot

Point your browser at http://<pi>:29316, log in, add the Kimono Kitten Matrix token as a client, upload a plugin, create an instance, invite the bot to your house room ‚Äî done.

Why builders like it
Hot-reload: upload a new .mbp; Maubot restarts the plugin without dropping connections.

E2EE handled: the framework negotiates Matrix encryption, you focus on behaviour.

HTTP hooks: every plugin can expose tiny REST endpoints (perfect for Home-Assistant webhooks).

Command decorators: @command.new("damms√∂g") makes natural-language triggers trivial.

Plugin library: ready-made echo, RSS, GPT, reminder, and webhook plugins to fork

Sketching your Rave Kitten skill
# file: chores/__init__.py
from maubot import Plugin
from mautrix.handlers import command
from mautrix.types import MessageEvent, TextMessageEventContent

class ChorePurr(Plugin):
    @command.new(name="damms√∂g", help="Log vacuuming a room (Swedish).")
    async def vacuumed(self, evt: MessageEvent) -> None:
        room = evt.room_id
        who  = evt.sender
        # 1¬∑ celebrate in chat
        gif = "https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYt5jPR6QX5pnqM/giphy.gif"
        body = f"üéâ {who} damms√∂g!  *Shiny floors unlocked.*"
        await evt.respond(TextMessageEventContent(body=body, url=gif))
        # 2¬∑ poke Home-Assistant
        await self.http.post("http://ha.local:8123/api/webhook/chores",
                             json={"chore": "vacuum", "user": who, "room": room})
Zip this with a minimal maubot.yaml, upload, and the bot will both cheer in Messenger and trigger your dashboard confetti via HA.

Subtle edges & good practice
Stay human-paced‚ÄÉMessenger‚Äôs spam detectors watch for machine-like rhythms; random-delay your celebratory GIFs or cap them per user.

One mind, many mouths‚ÄÉBecause Maubot can manage several clients, the same plugin logic can later drive Telegram or WhatsApp ghosts.

Backups‚ÄÉKeep a spare FB profile + Matrix login token sealed away; swapping it into the bridge is a 30-second fix if Meta nukes the first account.

Version control plugins‚ÄÉmbc build --upload pushes straight from Git to the running bot; rollbacks are a single tag away.

Next move
If you‚Äôd like, I can craft a full docker-compose.yml plus a ready-to-upload .mbp skeleton (with Swedish voice intent hooks) so you can test tonight. Shall we?
