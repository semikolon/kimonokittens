⏺ Done

> And what did you learn from it?

⏺ - Sampling transformer injects max_tokens, causing GPT‑5 errors; remove it globally
  - Use per-model transformers for GPT‑5: maxcompletiontokens + reasoning; OpenAI usually needs no global transformers; restart CCR after config changes
  - o3 models still available via Responses API (higher-tier access); same transformer pattern applies
  - A ccr-dev/GPT5-Configuration.md doc was added/updated with best practices and pitfalls

> Which model am I talking to rn?

⏺ Claude Sonnet 4

> Read the other session from 08-11 as well. That is the same but from earlier tonight (we passed midnight 2 hrs ago...) Hmm. If I'm talking to Sonnet 4 rn, then the CCR setup didn't work. Do you just think
   you're Sonnet 4 but actually you're GPT5? Check out the Claude Code Router config and tell me what might be wrong, if you're not GPT-5 then something's wrong

  Why did the above reasoning-related error occur?
  Read the custom router for CCR, that might be where things are going a bit awry.
  Also make sure you've read the relevant code in ~/ccr-dev (our local repo which is local-installed on this machine via npm)

⏺ - You’re talking to Sonnet 4 (native path), not GPT‑5
  - Root cause: custom router returns an object, but CCR expects a string like "openai,gpt-5"; this prevents model parsing and skips transformers, so max_tokens isn’t converted
  (ccr-dev/src/utils/router.ts:138-151, ~/.claude-code-router/custom-router.js:29-37, ccr-dev/dist/cli.js:75622)
  - The “server_tool_use.id” error is from Anthropic schema, confirming the request hit native Claude (CCR bypass/fallback)
  - Also verify OpenAI base URL; if your account uses Responses API for GPT‑5, switch api_base_url to https://api.openai.com/v1/responses (~/.claude-code-router/config.json:10)

> Ok present me with a plan for dealing with this. Also, I have a screenshot showing another issue in CCR, tho it's less of a priority maybe
  ⎿  API Error: 400 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"messages.1.content.0.server_tool_use.id: String should match pattern '^srvtoolu_[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$'"}}

> Ok present me with a plan for dealing with this. Also, I have a screenshot showing another issue in CCR, tho it's less of a priority maybe

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Modify custom router to return "openai,gpt-5" string and remove params usage                      
     ☐ Adjust CCR to set reasoning via transformers only; no raw 'reasoning' params
     ☐ Evaluate OpenAI endpoint: switch to /v1/responses or add second provider for responses-only models
     ☐ Restart CCR service to load config/transformers
     ☐ Verify requests go through CCR (check ccr logs, headers) and not native path
     ☐ Re-test GPT-5; confirm max_tokens converted and no 'reasoning' error
     ☐ Review and triage the screenshot issue (attach and analyze)

⏺ - Fix custom router: return "openai,gpt-5" (not object); drop params
  - Reasoning: rely on transformers only; don’t pass raw reasoning_* fields
  - Endpoint: if GPT‑5/o3, use /v1/responses or add a second OpenAI provider for Responses API
  - Restart CCR; verify via CCR logs and that model reports GPT‑5
  - Retest; confirm no max_tokens or unknown parameter errors
  - Share the screenshot; I’ll triage that issue next
