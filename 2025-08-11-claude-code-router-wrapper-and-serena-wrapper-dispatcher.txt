> This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
  Analysis:
  Let me chronologically analyze this conversation:

  1. **Initial Context**: The session started with a continuation from a previous conversation about testing MCP servers and configuring CCR (Claude Code Router). The user had been working on configuring 
  CCR with GPT-5 as main model and Gemini models for various tasks.

  2. **Environment Variable Issue**: User identified that CCR was loading with API key errors and wanted to use environment variables in the config without hardcoding them. They explicitly wanted to use 
  their Anthropic Max plan alongside foreign models.

  3. **Research and Solution Development**: I researched CCR's capabilities, found it doesn't support environment variable interpolation despite having dotenv dependency. User approved a plan to modify CCR 
  locally, with explicit instruction that they would create the PR themselves.

  4. **Implementation**: We cloned CCR to `/Users/fredrikbranstrom/ccr-dev`, analyzed the source code, and implemented environment variable interpolation by modifying `src/utils/index.ts` to add an 
  `interpolateEnvVars` function.

  5. **Authentication Clarification**: Critical discovery - user showed a screenshot of Claude Code prompting about API key usage. I researched and confirmed that using API keys bypasses Max plan benefits, 
  while OAuth authentication preserves them. User wanted to use Max plan for Anthropic models.

  6. **Model Version Research**: User corrected me about Claude model versions - Haiku 4.1 doesn't exist yet, only Haiku 3.5, Sonnet 4, and Opus 4.1 are available.

  7. **Configuration Refinement**: We removed Anthropic from CCR config entirely (to use native OAuth), configured background tasks to use gpt-5-mini, and changed web search from Flash to Pro per user 
  preference for handling complex searches.

  8. **Installation and Testing**: We built the modified CCR, installed it globally, verified environment variable interpolation works, and confirmed CCR service runs persistently.

  9. **Fork and PR Preparation**: User forked CCR to `semikolon/claude-code-router`, we prepared the feature branch with commits, documentation, and PR description.

  10. **Wrapper Architecture**: User revealed they have a Serena wrapper at `~/bin/claude` and wanted both Serena and CCR to be composable. After consulting Gemini via Zen MCP, we implemented a PATH-based 
  dispatcher architecture.

  11. **Flag Implementation**: User clarified they want CCR as default (for Cursor extensions) with `--native` flag to bypass CCR when needed.

  The conversation shows careful attention to preserving Max plan benefits, creating composable wrappers, and implementing environment variable support in CCR.

  Summary:
  1. **Primary Request and Intent:**
     - Configure CCR to use Anthropic Max plan alongside foreign models (GPT-5, Gemini) without hardcoding API keys
     - Implement environment variable interpolation in CCR config.json (currently unsupported feature)
     - Ensure background model uses Haiku (as default in Claude Code)
     - Make local modifications to CCR to support `$VARIABLE_NAME` syntax in config
     - User will create PR themselves after local implementation works
     - Remove Anthropic from CCR config to preserve Max plan benefits via OAuth
     - Create composable wrapper architecture combining Serena MCP server wrapper with CCR
     - Default behavior should use CCR (for Cursor extensions), with `--native` flag to bypass CCR

  2. **Key Technical Concepts:**
     - Claude Code Router (CCR) - proxy layer routing Claude Code to different AI models
     - Environment variable interpolation in JSON configuration files using `$VAR_NAME` or `${VAR_NAME}` syntax
     - Anthropic Max plan vs API pricing distinction (OAuth preserves Max plan, API keys trigger pay-per-use)
     - Model routing modes: default, background, think, longContext, webSearch
     - PATH-based wrapper composition architecture (Unix philosophy approach suggested by Gemini)
     - Custom router for "think hard" detection in last user message
     - GPT-5 context window: 400K tokens
     - Gemini 2.5 Flash: Ultra-fast (0.21-0.37s latency), 85% cheaper than Pro
     - Gemini 2.5 Pro: 1M token context window
     - Claude models: Haiku 3.5, Sonnet 4, Opus 4.1

  3. **Files and Code Sections:**
     - **/Users/fredrikbranstrom/ccr-dev/src/utils/index.ts**
        - Core file for implementing environment variable interpolation
        - Added `interpolateEnvVars` function to support env var substitution
        ```typescript
        const interpolateEnvVars = (obj: any): any => {
          if (typeof obj === "string") {
            return obj.replace(/\$\{([^}]+)\}|\$([A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*)/g, (match, braced, unbraced) => {
              const varName = braced || unbraced;
              return process.env[varName] || match;
            });
          } else if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
            return obj.map(interpolateEnvVars);
          } else if (obj !== null && typeof obj === "object") {
            const result: any = {};
            for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj)) {
              result[key] = interpolateEnvVars(value);
            }
            return result;
          }
          return obj;
        };
        ```
        - Modified `readConfigFile` to call `interpolateEnvVars(parsedConfig)`

     - **/Users/fredrikbranstrom/.claude-code-router/config.json**
        - Main CCR configuration file
        - Removed Anthropic provider entirely to preserve Max plan via OAuth
        - Final configuration:
        ```json
        {
          "LOG": true,
          "API_TIMEOUT_MS": 600000,

     - **/Users/fredrikbranstrom/bin/claude**
        - Original location of Serena wrapper (10KB file)
        - Replaced with smart dispatcher supporting `--native` flag
        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        # Claude Dispatcher: Smart wrapper composition with --native flag support
        # Default: claude → serena wrapper → ccr wrapper → claude-real
        # Native:  claude --native → serena wrapper → claude-real (skip CCR)
        
        WRAPPER_BASE_DIR="$HOME/.config/claude/wrappers.d"
        WRAPPER_ORDER=("serena" "ccr")
        
        # Check for --native flag and remove it from arguments
        ARGS=()
        USE_NATIVE=false
        for arg in "$@"; do
            if [[ "$arg" == "--native" ]]; then
                USE_NATIVE=true
            else
                ARGS+=("$arg")
            fi
        done
        ```

     - **~/.config/claude/wrappers.d/serena/claude**
        - Copy of original Serena wrapper (unchanged)
        - Preserves all Serena MCP server management functionality

     - **~/.config/claude/wrappers.d/ccr/claude**
        - New CCR wrapper
        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        if command -v ccr >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            if ! ccr status >/dev/null 2>&1; then
                echo "Starting CCR service..." >&2
                ccr start >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
                    echo "Failed to start CCR, falling back to direct Claude" >&2
                    exec claude "$@"
                }
            fi
            exec ccr code "$@"
        else
            exec claude "$@"
        fi
        ```

     - **~/.zshrc**
        - Added `unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` after loading secrets to prevent Claude Code API key prompt

  4. **Errors and Fixes:**
     - **API key loading errors in CCR**:
        - Root cause: CCR doesn't support environment variable interpolation in config.json
        - Fix: Implemented local modification to support `$VAR_NAME` syntax
     
     - **Initial belief about Haiku 4.1**:
        - Error: Assumed Haiku 4.1 existed
        - Fix: User corrected - only Haiku 3.5 exists, not 4.1
     
     - **Web search routing to Flash**:
        - Initial: Routed to Gemini 2.5 Flash for speed/cost
        - User feedback: "Use 2.5 Pro instead. It can be complex enough that it's worth it"
        - Fix: Changed to Gemini 2.5 Pro for better handling of complex searches

     - **Anthropic API key confusion**:
        - Initial misunderstanding: Thought API key usage was equivalent to OAuth
        - User showed screenshot of Claude Code warning about API key usage
        - Fix: Researched and confirmed OAuth preserves Max plan, removed Anthropic from CCR entirely

  5. **Problem Solving:**
     - **Solved**: CCR lacks environment variable interpolation - implemented custom solution
     - **Solved**: Max plan usage through CCR - removed Anthropic provider, rely on native OAuth fallback
     - **Solved**: Composable wrapper architecture - implemented PATH-based dispatcher with Gemini's guidance
     - **Solved**: Default CCR usage for Cursor - made CCR default with `--native` flag for bypass

  6. **All User Messages:**
     - "Hmm I added the anthropic key to zshrc now and this is what I get when relaunching claude just now... Why is it not recommended to use the API key? Are you absolutely sure that the default oauth(?) 
  login with a long-lived token is equivalent to using the API key if I have a MAX plan for Claude Code?"
     - "Probably anthropic shouldn't even be listed then as a provider? Or what does the CCR docs say on this?"
     - "Let's maybe try gpt-5-mini - find out the exact model name/text to put in"
     - "Hmm. Use 2.5 Pro instead. It can be complex enough that it's worth it, and I don't demand the speed of Flash here."
     - "Won't that server process exit once I exit CC though? How do we make sure that the ccr command on my machine uses the custom CCR that we modded?"
     - "Can you verify that the CCR terminal command leads to our modded version?"
     - "Cool. And I should answer no to using the anthropic api key when it prompts? Any way to avoid that prompt? Also, when there are updates to CCR, how do I integrate them?"
     - "Wait, make sure you added the unset AFTER the secrets are pulled in to zshrc?"
     - "Cool, thx. Now, back to CCR updates/contributing"
     - "Wait, describe your plan first"
     - "Fork + PR sounds good. But submitting the PR would require either web access (by me) or using a GitHub MCP or something, right?"
     - "Already created the PR, as I said :) If I start 'claude' then it will not use CCR, tho?"
     - "I have a custom Serena-backing wrapper in ~/bin/claude... Maybe we can make some elegant solution that wraps both?"
     - "Wait, which directory are we in right now? Are we in the kimonokittens repo? We should be in the ccr dir, right?"
     - "Yes please"
     - "Wait - is the GIT repo we're currently operating on the right repo? Just double checking"
     - "Proceed"
     - "Forked it to semikolon/claude-code-router!"
     - "Can the workflow for future updates be included in a local uncommitted .md file?"
     - "Make it more concise, only include the commands not so many comments"
     - "Great. And now what are the next steps for me to do? Just quit claude and restart?"
     - "Env var interpolation for sure works? Are you dead sure about it?"
     - "Wait, first: Where is my Serena wrapper located?"
     - "Matches Gemini's architecture, huh? Oh, did Gemini suggest this dir structure? I guess it looks good. Go ahead."
     - "Wait, I think I actually want to be able to choose whether I run the default CC or whether I run CCR"
     - "More like a flag to use the original cc - because I want the default for use inside Cursor"
     - "Native sounds best. Go ahead!"
     - "But hey, the Max plan will still be used even in CCR when calling Anthropic models"
     - "Yes, well, the --native flag goes straight to the 'actual' CC binary"

  7. **Pending Tasks:**
     - None explicitly pending - all requested tasks have been completed

  8. **Current Work:**
     Just completed setting up the wrapper architecture with:
     - Smart dispatcher at `~/bin/claude` with `--native` flag support
     - Serena wrapper at `~/.config/claude/wrappers.d/serena/claude`
     - CCR wrapper at `~/.config/claude/wrappers.d/ccr/claude`
     - Verified both wrappers are executable and in place
     
     The system is now configured so that:
     - `claude` (default) → Serena + CCR → foreign models
     - `claude --native` → Serena + native Claude → Max plan direct access

  9. **Optional Next Step:**
     The wrapper architecture is complete and ready for testing. The logical next step would be to verify the entire setup works as expected by testing both paths (`claude` and `claude --native`), but this 
  should only be done after the user quits and restarts Claude Code as they indicated they would do..
  Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

⏺ Perfect! The wrapper architecture is now fully set up and ready for use. Let me verify everything is in place:

⏺ Excellent! Your complete setup is now ready:

  🎯 Setup Complete

  Your wrapper system now provides:

  - claude (default) → Serena + CCR → GPT-5, Gemini models
  - claude --native → Serena + Native Claude → Max plan direct access

  CCR Configuration:
  - Environment variable interpolation working ($OPENAI_API_KEY, $GEMINI_API_KEY)
  - No Anthropic provider (preserves Max plan via OAuth)
  - Background tasks use gpt-5-mini
  - Web search uses gemini-2.5-pro

  Ready for testing! When you restart Claude Code:

  1. Test CCR path: Just run claude - it should start CCR service automatically and route to foreign models
  2. Test native path: Run claude --native - bypasses CCR completely, uses Max plan directly
  3. CCR will start automatically when first accessed (shown in the wrapper logs)

  The Max plan will still be preserved for any Anthropic model calls, and you have the --native flag ready for Cursor extensions that need the default CCR routing.

> Ok before I run this myself... Can we verify as well as we can that this should work every step of the way and run both wrappers and that they should do their thing, without actually running it for real?

⏺ Read(../../.config/claude/wrappers.d/ccr/claude)
  ⎿  Read 21 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Found the problem! The CCR wrapper is calling claude recursively. When CCR fails to start (line 12) or when CCR is not available (line 20), it calls exec claude "$@" which goes back to our dispatcher,
  creating an infinite loop.

> Wait - all the wrappers need this fix then? Even the Serena wrapper? Because what if somebody adds a wrapper that should be run after Serena or whatever? The wrappers need to be easily composable, recall 
  that?

⏺ You're absolutely right! This is a fundamental design flaw. Every wrapper needs to avoid recursion by calling the next wrapper in the chain, not just claude. Let me fix both wrappers:

⏺ Good! The Serena wrapper already uses ${real_claude} (resolved at startup) instead of calling claude recursively. But let me check how it finds real_claude:

                  rbenv model is indeed hub-and-spoke: shim → rbenv exec → real binary.\n\nMy situation is different - I need true chaining: wrapper1 → wrapper2 → wrapper3 → real binary. Based on your
                  analysis and the robust `find_next_in_path` function you provided, I think PATH manipulation is indeed the way to go.\n\nHowever, I want to clarify one key difference from your approach:
                  instead of finding the \"next executable after the current one\", I think each wrapper should find the \"next executable that isn't itself\", meaning it excludes its own directory from
                  PATH and finds the first match. This is simpler and more robust than trying to track position in the chain.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking:\n\n1. Each wrapper filters out its own directory
                  from PATH\n2. Uses `command -v claude` to find the next wrapper/binary\n3. Calls `exec` with that path\n\nThis is exactly what the existing Serena wrapper
                  does:\n```bash\nfiltered_path=$(echo \"${PATH}\" | tr ':' '\\n' | grep -v \"^$(dirname \"$0\")$\" | tr '\\n' ':' | sed 's/:$//')\nnext_claude=$(PATH=\"${filtered_path}\" command -v
                  claude)\nexec \"${next_claude}\" \"$@\"\n```\n\nIs this approach sound? Should I standardize all wrappers to use this pattern?", model: "gemini-2.5-pro")

     ☒ Implement robust wrapper pattern for CCR
     ☒ Update Serena wrapper with robust pattern
     ☒ Test the complete fixed wrapper chain

⏺ ✅ Fixed! Recursion Issue Resolved

  Root Cause: The CCR wrapper was calling claude recursively instead of finding the next wrapper in the chain.

  Solution: Implemented Gemini's robust composable wrapper pattern where each wrapper:
  1. Filters out its own directory from PATH using grep -Fxv (safe for special chars)
  2. Uses command -v claude to find the next executable in the chain
  3. Calls exec with that specific path (no recursion)

  Key Improvements:
  - Robust PATH filtering: Uses paste -sd: instead of tr | sed for safer path reassembly
  - Fixed-string matching: grep -Fxv prevents regex metacharacter issues
  - Better error handling: Clear error messages if chain is broken
  - POSIX compliant: Uses #!/bin/sh and set -eu for reliability

  Execution Flow Now:
  claude → dispatcher → ccr wrapper → serena wrapper → real claude
  claude --native → dispatcher → serena wrapper → real claude

  The fix ensures:
  - No infinite recursion loops
  - Each wrapper cleanly passes control to the next
  - Composable design (easy to add/remove/reorder wrappers)
  - Robust error handling with helpful messages

  Ready to test! The wrapper chain should now work without hanging.
